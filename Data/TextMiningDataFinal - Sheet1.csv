Reddit, Google will replace ChatGPT.  All they have to do is just put ChatGPT module at the top of their search page and integrate it into Google Assistant.  Literally nothing stops them from doing this.  I used to run a successful site that people would go to to enter their package tracking numbers.  Then one day I noticed my Adsense revenue was down 80% and traffic also significantly down.   That was when Google added package tracking to search results.,No
Reddit,It‚Äôs already replaced it in many cases for me.,Yes
Reddit,"There is zero chance.

BTW, people seem to not realize the company that invented transformers or the T in GPT is Google.  Luckily they did not lock away but let others use.",No
Reddit,"Probably yes, maybe that‚Äôs why pichar sounded the red alarm",Yes
Reddit,I use both,Neutral
Reddit,"Time to step it up Google!

Evolve or die!",Neutral
Reddit,"I haven‚Äôt closed my ChatGPT tab in like 3 weeks. Going on Google now feels like a battle through advertisers Hell in which it takes me 10x as long to find the info I need. 

Glad Google is getting a kick in the shin, maybe they‚Äôll improve their dogshit search results and interface.",Yes
Reddit,"I asked ChatGPT the following:  ‚ÄúDo you think chatgpt could be a competitive threat to google‚Äôs core search capability?‚Äù

Here‚Äôs the reply:

‚ÄúIt is unlikely that ChatGPT, or any other language model, could pose a significant threat to Google's core search capabilities. Google has a vast infrastructure and resources dedicated to improving and maintaining the quality and accuracy of its search results, and it is constantly working to improve and adapt its algorithms to provide the most relevant and useful results to users. In addition, Google has a vast amount of data and information at its disposal, which it uses to better understand and interpret user queries and to provide more accurate search results.

However, it is possible that ChatGPT or other language models could be used to augment or enhance certain aspects of search or to provide additional functionality, such as natural language processing or conversational interfaces for search. In these cases, language models could potentially be used to improve the user experience or to provide additional value to users, but they would not be a direct replacement for Google's core search capabilities.‚Äù",Maybe
Reddit,"they had their own chat bot 'Meena' which was supposed to be released in 2020, this might call for a release of that",Neutral
Reddit,The mainstream media seems to think Google is freaking out over ChatGPT's potential to disrupt them.,Neutral
Reddit,"The error tolerance, improvisation, and adaptation I‚Äôve seen chat gpt achieve is unheard of.  It can not only ‚Äúanswer‚Äù questions but adapt solutions based on the the history of a conversation, complete with margin of error on each proposal.  The fact that it seems to understand it‚Äôs limits on a given query, yet still attempt to answer with caveats is unprecedented in a consumer facing piece of software.  That it can return working code snippets with machine learning libraries pulled in correctly to python is also absolutely crazy, even if they aren‚Äôt complete.  It can translate between conceptual inquiry and machine code the way a media encoder can convert a QuickTime file to mp4 and its faster in the process.  To call it a game changer is a very dramatic understatement, it‚Äôs downright scary.  Google has a right to be worried as it‚Äôs just in beta now,",Maybe
Reddit,I only use Google when I use YouTube lol üòÇ seriously Google became obsolete overnight.,Yes
Reddit,"They don't. They just take whatever it spits out then come to reddit to shit on Google. 

ChatGTP is amazing but a predictive text platform is, pretty much by definition, not a threat to something like Google's knowledge graph.",No
Reddit,"I never understand this kind of take. Just use an adblocker. I have literaly never had a problem with Google results thanks to ublock. And chatgpt won't give you accurate results. It's a language model. Or doesn't knoe what it's saying. It just spits out what is most likely to come next. Sometimes it's true, but often it's false, and in ways that are difficult to tell. Just a week ago, it passionately argued that a pound of steel was heavier than a pound of paper. Why anyone would use this over google search is mind boggling.",No
Reddit,"Yeah, no need for Google anymore. Before 2021 - use ChatGPT, after September 2021 - use Twitter. Google can go. Elon is a very smart guy.",Yes
Reddit,"My favorite thing to do is ask chatGPT how it works. I asked if it's learning from our interaction:

As a large language model, I was trained on a dataset of billions of  
words and phrases from a wide range of sources, including books,  
articles, websites, and other texts. This training allows me to  
understand and generate human-like text, and to provide information and  
assistance based on the queries and requests of users.

I do not have the ability to learn or adapt based on individual interactions with users. Instead, I use the knowledge and information that was provided to me during my training to generate responses to user queries and requests.",
Reddit,Yea but what is the chance that it‚Äôs better equipped than OpenAI or the projects that use their API? At the end of the day Google would only do this as a secondary survival tactic compared to OpenAI who‚Äôs sole focus is maximise benefit from AI.,
Reddit,"they might be. they know the impact of having this available 24/7, for free, so I'm pretty sure they've been thinking about possible scenarios for some time.

I haven't used Google for a week, or more. I used chatGPT all week instead, for queries.",
Reddit,"Agreed in ChatGPT not being the solution yet, but adblocking is certainly not the answer to Googles problems. Depending on the topic, some search results are just SEO spam now with super generic autogenerated content, as well as all results just having the same information pushing the in-depth results out.",
Reddit,I have tried chatGPT. Why would you assume something so ridiculous. These answers were the ones it gave me. And the fact that chatgpt would get a B- in university essays is more an indictment of how essays are graded in university than a commendation of the model.,
Reddit,"yes, but there's always the possibility of others appearing, and at one point, it might be free. a company like Google has to prepare for this, even if it doesn't happen.",
Reddit,"It would probably be more profitable just to get a bigger funding sponsorship from Microsoft and let them market it into their products like Bing. By the time OpenAI build a real product, LaMDA and others would already be doing pretty much the same thing.",
Reddit,"People are aware that Google search is running an AI as well, right? It will be at least as good as chatGPT at understanding natural language, and better at converting that request into page rankings.",
Reddit,Not with their current business model.,
Reddit,"No, I don't think ChatGPT will replace our jobs. It's a powerful tool for automation and natural language processing, but it's not capable of replacing the creativity and insight that humans bring to the table. ChatGPT may be able to automate certain tasks, but it won't be able to replace the human element of our jobs.",
Reddit,"For some menial and low effort jobs, yes. For others, AI will provide efficient and dependable knowledge resourcing. Technology is really good at enabling, not so much at decision-making or determining right from wrong. AI should not be feared any more than human intelligence... both are equally able to destroy humanity without balance and proper controls in place for protection and quality of life.",
Reddit,Hopefully,
Reddit,I think it already has replaced some reddit posters job.,
Reddit,"ChatGPT probably not. An Artificial General Intelligence, very likely",
Reddit,"ChatGPT is mostly a toy now. But within 5 years there will be AI tools that will make things 50x easier/quicker in most cognitive work professions.

It will create jobs.

It will be like Photoshop in the 90s. Graphic designers back then hated it. It made their job easier yet enabled noobs. Fast forward 10 years, there were 10x as many graphic designers, the profession paid well and the overall bar for quality went up. 

‚Äî

AGI may eliminate jobs but society will adjust. You may just get UBI to play in VR all day. The dream is real man üòá",
Reddit,"I wrote an article about it. I don't think AI will replace my current job, but it would have replaced my job when I was getting started. My first jobs were menial, boring, low-paid and didn't require much thought. The absolute perfect thing for AI and ChatGPT is probably already plenty good enough for it. 

https://theunhedgedcapitalist.substack.com/p/how-chatgpt-would-have-changed-my",
Reddit,It will not replace our jobs completely but in some professions fewer people are going to be needed because one person with tools like ChatGPT can maybe be as efficient as 2 or more people and it is cheaper to have fewer employees.,
Reddit,"ChatGPT can create more jobs with the help of virtual customers. A robot customer can visit a store, is buying some gear oil and asks for the manager if he has a complain. To fulfill the needs of these AI enhanced paying customers lots of human labor is needed.",
Reddit,It will absolutely destroy jobs. It‚Äôs not a question.,
Reddit,You asked a clear question ‚Äúwill ChatGPT be better than Google search‚Äù yet the answers don‚Äôt say ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúother middle options‚Äù. I might agree with all of your statements but still would want to say no,
Reddit,"MGoogle has far more data than ChatGPTs model, far more resources than OpenAI, and the infrastructure to support it. Of course Microsoft now opens OpenAPI and honestly, Bing has been better than Google for almost the last year in terms of returning useful links.

So essentially I think Google and Microsoft are going to have similar products with different focuses. I imagine that Microsoft is going to focus their model on developer related topics, where Google will focus theirs on more generalized questions. That's just my guess",
Reddit,"This is an interesting question! It's hard to say who will come out on top between ChatGPT and Google's Apprentice Bard. On one hand, ChatGPT is a natural language processing system developed by OpenAI that has been trained on millions of conversations. On the other hand, Google's Apprentice Bard is an AI-driven storytelling system that was designed to help create stories and immersive experiences. Both of these systems have their own strengths and weaknesses, so it will be interesting to see which one comes out on top!",
Reddit,"It literally cannot replace Google. ChatGPT costs several orders of magnitude more than a Google Search, having billions of users per day (!!!) would at best be so slow it might as well be unusable or would simply make OpenAI bleed money until they'd inevitably fold at best. People severely tend to underestimate how cheap Google Search costs. It has been optimized to death at this point.",
Reddit,"For code production it requires a lot more training, at least in my experience. Furthermore in order to be useful it would require to be up date always",
Reddit,Actually I don‚Äôt want this. Let it be a secret tool for a tiny percentage of people who can excel in their fields using this tool :) Let the rest of humanity use Google ;),
Reddit,ChatGPT can't replace search engines.,
Reddit,"Since Google is concerned about OpenAI it means they don't compete well with it. Or they at least think they don't. Give it 5 years and we'll have a competing model right from Google, so OpenAI doesn't actually matter in the long run IMO.",
Reddit,It can't replace search engine,
Reddit,"It's not a replacement, but it does the job for many common search queries just as well or better than a Google Search would because it can clarify and re-explain things exactly to your specifications",
Reddit,"Google have their own one, they just haven‚Äôt made it public.

And the footage I saw from 3 years ago of it making a call and booking an appointment all in a voice that was indistinguishable from a human 
was quite impressive.

I‚Äôll try and find it.",
Reddit,"The answer is NO as it will cause millions to lose their livelihoods and monopoly corporations will have all the control of information.

This is why ""Open"" AI was supposed to be open source in the first place... until they sold their soul to the devil",
Reddit,"Google is in code red. 

They already have very good chat model but don't want to release it because they NEED people to search for stuff so they can push paid results and ads. Their entire model is based on selling advertisement. Ai needs to be non-biased, hence incompatible with google.",
Reddit,"Also 100% true, I am a programmer and it has provided me with wrong code everytime i ask for something even slightly complicated.",
Reddit,"haha, actually I agree with you, I don't think a service can accurately produce the one and only answer to all questions",
Reddit,"No it won't ever. At least not for elementary school kids. There is no way an AI could replicate the physical presence and energy that a teacher brings to a classroom to create a learning environment. 

Not all teachers but ther are amazing ones that literally could not ever be replaced by something inorganic.",
Reddit,"It absolutely will be replacing teachers and it will be a lot sooner than most think.  


People are biased in all aspects of AI job displacement due to self-preservation. They can't/refuse to come the realization that this will be the new reality. It happened when the internet first came out and it happened with cellphones. People will either get with the program or get left behind.  


Teachers will be replaced but not by robots in the short term. They will be replaced short term by chat bots like chatGPT and be used at home. It would cut government schooling costs by exponential amounts. But it's okay, almost everyone will be ""displaced"". They can just stay home and make sure their kids actually do their schoolwork. It would actually be objectively better because the AI could tailer to the students needs.",
Reddit,I mean ChatGPT definitely won‚Äôt but other AIs down the line might replace teachers eventually. However by the time that happens almost all jobs will be capable of being done by an AI so I would t worry about it for the time being.,
Reddit,"No, but it will get rid of pure researchers Infront of class. Competition with an inexhaustible resource like chatgpt will require professors to be far better than they are now.",
Reddit,"It will eventually replace teachers. Eventually. Not something like ChatGPT that can't think. Something better eventually will, so that pupils will be taught by a sophisticated teaching AI and the job of teacher gets a more psychological aspect. But eventually ever job will be replaced. At least hopefully will be replaced.",
Reddit,"Doubt it - teachers are counselors, they manage behaviors. AI can‚Äôt control a classroom environment or help manage a humans emotions. Not anytime soon anyway.",
Reddit,"It will absolutely not replace lower elementary teaching any time soon, which is more than half about instilling social norms in small children. You could probably make a touchscreen version that understands spoken language and could teach some reading, and the teacher would be more of just providing childcare. I think that would be a bad idea, though. 

It probably can replace much of secondary education as soon as it stops saying clearly false things with confidence.",
Reddit,"If an AI replaces teachers, we don‚Äôt need schools anymore. Society itself would completely collapse. What would be the point of learning anything if you can automate everything out? 

In more specific terms:

1. There‚Äôs more to education than the acquisition of hard knowledge. Schools play a fundamental role in socialization. In the US, it‚Äôs also a safety net for kids who can‚Äôt eat with school lunches. Plus, it prevents a breakdown in the social order - if kids are entirely on their own, who keeps discipline? Why won‚Äôt they just do whatever they want? Why not just have a ton of gangs? It‚Äôs exceedingly shortsighted to think teachers only teach or give information.

2. People who learn about AI see this as a magic wand. It‚Äôs very much a black-or-white way of thinking. Truth is that nothing works out as badly or as well as we tend to predict. Most of the discussions right now about ‚Äúwill AI replace X profession‚Äù is being driven entirely by emotion. We don‚Äôt have enough data yet to know how it will impact society. Period.",
Reddit,I hope it at least changes them. With all the information out there we‚Äôre more likely to call them Shepard‚Äôs.,
Reddit,"Not ChatGPT, but AI in the form of adaptive learning will. China is already using it in nearly 20% of schools.

There will be several stages, now it's in just app form, but once they link the apps to screens, then later holograms, you'll be able to have for example, a Shakespeare avatar teach British lit, individually (or in a group if you want slower learners). Or have an Einstein ADaptive learning avatar (on screen or a floating hologram or VR) teach science.

Kids still bored? Switch to a high humor (but still solid content) Bugs Bunny to teach Geography. Or combine them.

ChatGPT can give you a sense of the potential.

Try this: ""Write a Shakespearean sonnet about the history of (X US state), using double entendre, in the voice of (favorite Looney Tunes character) and their catchphrases.""

Now take that result and put it in as real a visual form as technology allows, and welcome to the new AI teacher.

There will still be a need for humans, but instead of delivering the bulk of the content, kids will be progress at their own pace. The humans will be more like tutor/counselor, but they'll spend time helping kids one on one, clarify topics, projects and whatnot.

We had the beginnings for the tech 2 years ago, but Teacher's Unions were afraid of it then, more so now.

It's a shame, because we'd have trillions invested in adaptive learning by now if education money went to this model decades ago, and we'd probably all have a floating Gazoo hologram teacher by now.

![gif](giphy|3o6ZsXxK0TerLizZpm)",
Reddit,"AI will replace teachers as we know them today. Teachers that just teach ""facts"" will no longer be able to compete with an AI that can adapt to each kid's limitations and skills. Teachers of the future will need to focus on teaching a whole new set of skills that are rarely taught today:

* how to communicate effectively
* how to socialize
* how to handle conflict
* how to influence people/bots
* how to innovate
* how to be productive
* how to transform ideas into reality
* how to stay healthy mentally
* how to exercise properly
* how to think creatively (beyond what bots can do)
* how to interact with other neurodiverse people
* etc.

Most teachers today don't focus on these skills so I imagine a new generation of schools/teachers will emerge. If COVID taught us anything is that parents will always need to send the kids somewhere (for their own sanity). Ideally, a place that will prepare their kids for the AI-era.",
Reddit,"Not yet. The tool itself will need decade's of upgrades before being able to replace teaching. Even then it will probably only be for the elite.

The example that I'm thinking about is the vr type of classroom in the cyberpunk anime. That would probably be the level we are on about.

As a tool however, I think education needs to start adopting it...but then again, I think schools need a revamp and a higher level of technology as that's the future anyways",
Reddit,"Eventually. AI will replace virtually all jobs. Just not during our lifetime. 

AI has been researched and developed since 1951.",
Reddit,"Will replace? That's wrong to me, since I already dumped idea of hiring personal mentor and studied at least 67 hours with ChatGPT just at home. (I track time)",
Reddit,I teach in a well respected university. It will replace both teachers and students‚Ä¶,
Reddit,"I am teacher myself since 10 years and I am near my licence in the field of the Sciences of the Education.  


My opinion is that this particular professor seems to have a simplistic vision of the two notions he proposes: teaching and AI.  

The fact is that a ""good"" teacher (by which I mean a trained, qualified and passionate person) can never be replaced by a robot. Because in my opinion, there is an artistic part in teaching and transmitting knowledge. 

We all preferred one or the other teacher because he or she was invested and inhabited by his teaching.  Robots are good at their automation. Certainly they will be able to help the teacher for, for example, simple information, documentation, factualization or other repetition exercises (""drill"").  

But an AI, for example, will never be able to make many analogies between a hydraulic system and an electrical system in order to teach series and parallel assemblies, demonstrate what the electrical intensity as well as the voltage in using an analogy with a ski slope, highways, etc.  She will not be able to find THE right animation or video to try out a very precise explanation, on the Joule effect and the agitation of atoms in order to show the heating of a resistance...  

I would add that a Robot will never handle chemicals so well to make complex reactions, use an elastic web to show Einstein's general relativity, etc, etc.  

The robots will serve teachers AND students.  I regret that this professor chooses the cleavage between the two.",
Reddit,"In western world schools are used for teaching  but also as daycare where physical presence and actions are often required. LLM can‚Äôt do the social leadership, role modeling, empathy and many other functions an adult can provide. This part is not going anywhere anytime soon. 

As for the process of transferring knowledge, helping with homework‚Äôs, tutoring, explaining concepts, leading to solutions, checking tests etc, yes, this part is going to shift towards personalized AI education.",
Reddit,Yes,
Reddit,For online training possibly.,
Reddit,Ask us in 20 years from now.,
Reddit,Yes.,
Reddit,No.,
Reddit,"Yes, because like everything else, teaching is a service that can be taken or left depending on the consumer. People will choose to treat AI as a teacher and therefore it will replace teachers in that instance.  Hell, people are already treating chatGPT like that in some cases. That will likely only increase as AI becomes better.",
Reddit,"Eventually, I think it will. But that could be thousands of years from now or in 50 years. Hard to predict.",
Reddit,"So a very respected professor came to me today and claimed that AI will replace teachers. Of course, I laughed it out. I believe that there is no way that an AI will replace the human side of mentorship, teacher-student social relationships, and many other advantages that come with the humanness of the experience. The Professor was, however, so convinced that the children of the future will be taught by bots. He was ready to debate me on this matter and that is why I am here. Do you guys think AI can replace human teachers?",
Reddit,Totally no way,
Reddit,"I am with you. People believe Chat GPT 3.5 is the final product and interpolate everything from here. Its just the entry point into a new era. Its the same with the first steam engines... people couldnt get their head around that there would be better engines etc. and fantasized about the ""steam punk future"" where all modern tools are related to steam engines. Like ChatGPT steam engines where just the entry point.",
Reddit,"From what I've seen when people ask if it will replace google, they are talking about the future lol.",
Reddit,I don‚Äôt see it replacing Google. A text generator replacing a real time search engine? It‚Äôs very apples to oranges. Notice the word ‚Äúreplace‚Äù lol,
Reddit,Google has LamDA yes. With their resources and research capacity I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if google owns this space sooner or later. Google has the upper hand long term  IMHO.,
Reddit,"They appear to share some similarities. At a very niche level. For example: Google isn‚Äôt meant to generate recipes , ChatGPT is very good at that. But what Google excels at is giving you a list of options to choose from. There‚Äôs a caveat though, ChatGPT lacks true knowledge about a topic and it waffles it‚Äôs way. Look into AI hallucination on Wikipedia.",
Reddit,Unless Google go back to the good old days when they actually served up good search results instead of adverts then I believe the impact on Google could be massive.,
Reddit,I'm doubtful that Google is sitting on their thumbs regarding ChatGPT. They and Facebook are sitting on a ton of data to feed their version/answer to ChatGPT.,
Reddit,"I doubt it. The number of google searches have dropped significantly ever since I started using chatgpt for research and learning. It is just so much quicker to get contextually strutured knowledge about a problem, instead of shifting through tens of low effort blog posts and forums looking for an answer.

If there is a tool that allows them to acquire knowledge 10x faster and that can adapt, simplify and expand on topics according to the user, than old search will simply soon be left behind. No self assurance blogpost paid by google's PR department will change that fact.",
Reddit,"People forget Google Lamda is a thing, they've kept it restricted, and the few people who have gotten to access it have only said the most positive things especially when it comes to creative thought. Zoe Kleinman from the BBC said she got 30 minutes with it but this was a month before ChatGPT was publicly released and I haven't been able to find if she was able to compare her experiences between the two.",
Reddit,"Last week, The Information reported that Microsoft and OpenAI are working on a ChatGPT-powered version of Bing. A use case that raised eyebrows was ChatGPT's ability to answer questions in concise and straightforward language, which seemed like a much better experience than the one we‚Äôre used to on Google.

ChatGPT was alarming enough for Google to declare a ""code red"" and prioritize the release of its own AI products. Google has been building similar large language models (LLMs) but has been much more secretive and cautious about them. You may recall last summer's controversy when a Google engineer claimed that LaMDA, Google's chatbot, was sentient. And Google even built one of the core technologies powering ChatGPT. We don‚Äôt know how powerful Google‚Äôs chatbot and other AI products they‚Äôve created are, but we know they have the talent and funds to compete.

Currently, Google commands 85% of the global search market, while Bing only accounts for 9%. So Microsoft doesn‚Äôt have as much to lose as Google, which explains its higher risk tolerance in releasing a first-of-its-kind product that could be less reliable and provide false information.

But the bigger news is that Microsoft intends to add OpenAI's chatbot technology to its Office apps. Microsoft Office accounts for 23% of the company's revenue, compared to only 6% from Bing ads.

Having generative AI capabilities built into these Office apps will become a competitive advantage for companies that use them. And every company will end up paying for the premium tier of AI-powered Office apps so they can keep up with their competition.

\----------

The integration of generative AI into Office apps will completely change the way we work. I can't wait to see how all of this unfolds...",
Reddit,I kind if disagree. I am already using chatGPT to get answers to questions instead of typing into Google.,
Reddit,"Yup. This weekend I relied heavily on Google to find things I needed, contact numbers for businesses, and get me to places I wanted to go. Not once on my phone did I think ""hey chatgpt probably knows where they have this thing I need right now""

When I wanted to know the weather this morning I said hey Google.",
Reddit,"Google either needs to buy out ChatGPT or create their own and incorporate it into their search algorithm.
They need to move extremely fast, weeks, or months at worst. Otherwise, Google can join Yahoo on the scrapheap of tech that once mattered.
I can imagine ChatGPT has been getting offers left right and centre to buy it out.",
Reddit,I've noticed chatgpt gave me more direct answers and in an amount of time faster than if just used google. Though I always verify and not take chatgpt as law. Treat it like Wikipedia in a way. But so far it's been very accurate in its results.,
Reddit,"As someone who works in AI, this is like saying ""motor engines won't kill carriage services. Their biggest impact will be farms"". In reality, motor engines obviated horses entirely, changed the face of everything from sport to how we wage war, and every industry in between.

Modelling language reliably means we can intuitively define problems for computers, and literally any functional aspect of life can be integrated with this.",
Reddit,"Google is already a useless dumpster fire of ads and shit blogs. My main uses for chatgpt so far have been asking the kinds of targeted questions I used to be able to pose to Google, but no longer can because of the nonsense it sends back to me. If AI can do absolutely anything to help us be able to find information we are looking for online, I'm absolutely here for it.",
Reddit,"This is an interesting trend but I‚Äôm having trouble identifying general search queries that would benefit from services like ChatGPT.

Can someone provide some examples that are not about generating code snippets or people trying to plagiarize creative works?",
Reddit,"ChatGPT won't help google. It will help bing and if google doesn't make something similar, bing will overtake.",
Reddit,"I think this article is very short sighted. Even in it's early state, I am already using ChatGPT for things I would have traditionally used a legacy search engine like Google for. When I need a direct answer for something that doesn't require or rely on a persona opinion, I can just ask ChatGPT and it gives me a direct answer without having to sift through paid results and ads. Why would use a Search engine over ChatGPT - especially when V2 comes out which will trained on 100 times more data and have access to the public internet?",
Reddit,Seriously. I‚Äôve been a Google user since the 90‚Äôs. Last week I switched to querying ChatGpt because it‚Äôs far better in format and relevance.,
Reddit,I think ChatGPT is putting some much-needed pressure on them to re-evaluate their priorities of serving ads vs serving users like us,
Reddit,"The premise of the article is that ChatGPT combined with Bing will help Google see how people use, misuse, and if they will pay for a chatbot search engine while taking none of the risk. If chatbots are the future of search, Google will release a better version of it. They have the most reliable search engine after all",
Reddit,Exactly. They don‚Äôt want to unleash their beasts too fast. OpenAI is a private startup that can afford doing that. They have investors and stock price to worry about‚Ä¶,
Reddit,"Yeah, because the majority of Google searches are about research, learning and getting contextually structured knowledge.",
Reddit,"How do you determine that a LLM like chatGPT serve better results when you dont know if the information that it produces is true or not.

This is a huge issue, because these bots are flawed in the way that they are convincing no matter how bad an answer they give.

Also these models are trained on an incredible amount og data, but are not able to crawl the web yet, so any new info will not be taken into consideration by the AI when giving answers. 

That is not great if a pandemic breaks out, but neat if you want to know about history.

I think it‚Äôs too soon to say it will replace Google‚Äôs search engine since it does a totally different job.

In terms of including it in app and automating different tasks I think you‚Äôre right it will be a gamechanger soon.",
Reddit,"I think a small caveat against ChatGPT in this sense is that its answer is biased by its training and it only offers a single concise response to a question, whereas Google returns a list of results which the reader can pick and choose which one appeals to their own biases.",
Reddit,"Yep. I don‚Äôt need 20 links to jargon answers. I need good answers, links be damned.",
Reddit,"I agree but I think Google will end up making a better chatbot search engine after seeing what Microsoft does with Bing+ChatGPT. That‚Äôs how ChatGPT will ‚Äúhelp‚Äù Google, by seeing if this is an approach worth pursuing

Also I‚Äôll trust Google over Bing to give me better search results if they both have similar chatbots",
Reddit,If anything Google is just going to use AI to serve ads better. They don‚Äôt give a shit about you finding what you‚Äôre looking for,
Reddit,Google Assistant is already doing many of those things. I'm pretty sure Google has arrived there much earlier than OpenAI but they don't want to potentially cannibalize their business.,
Reddit,"They are talking about potential not usage right now

Chatgpt is still experimental but it is going places",
Reddit,"Chatgpt will be even better to serve us ads and sponsored content, since we do not criticize the AI answer",
Reddit,new google ai to serve me up even more manipulative advertising than ever before üòä,
Reddit,ChatGPT is confidently wrong all the damn time.,
Reddit,ChatGPT is good assistant. It's pretty smart if you ask question right and trust them in a limited extent. But even this bleeding-edge tech is far away from replacing anyone.,
Reddit,"No, ChatGPT will neither replace Google nor it will help you earn thousands of dollars. It can make you more productive, that‚Äôs it!",
Reddit,Not if you keep searching for it on Google...,
Reddit,"It‚Äôs replaced a lot of the genre questions I use google for, I don‚Äôt even use google for aearch anymore I use sites like Reddit and hacker news to begin my search",
Reddit,I don't think it'll replace google more likely it will become a *middle man* that will *learn* Google's special search terms and help you get better results with said search engine(s),
Reddit,I doubt it will be free for much longer. That will keep it from replacing Google.,
Reddit,"You do realize the T in ChatGPT was invented by Google?  We are just lucky Google lets others use their IP.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)

Google has nothing to worry about.  There is a number of problems with using ChatGPT and a big one is cost.  Google is handling 100s of thousands of search queries every second.  It is not yet scalable.  But when it does become scalable Google is in a much better position to take advantage.

Reddit,"I do see them as different tools, but quite a lot of Google's traffic is people asking questions like: ""How do I cook pancakes?"" or ""Who invented the frying pan?"" or ""What should I do if I've poisoned my partner with uncooked pancakes?"" etc...

I think it's reasonable to think those sorts of searches could be replaced by if not ChatGPT, then some AI. Google Assistant is already quite similar, you can ask those sorts of questions and you get back: ""according to Wikipedia, the appropriate response is to dial your local emergency services"" but if it's the

Reddit,Was listening to a talk by Google Brain team leads and they were concerned that ML chat models like ChatGPT tend to hallucinate things when they don't know the answer.,
Reddit,Chatgpt is overhyped,
Reddit,I would bet it's ahead.,
Reddit,"If you ask me a question, what would you prefer:

1. I answer from memory and make up what I don't know.
2. I go through a bunch of books, summarize the relevant parts, and give you the page numbers.

I may be able to accurately tell you how to make pancakes without knowing where I got that from, but ask me how to bake a cake and you'd prefer me reading a few cookbooks before coming back to you with a recipe. 

ChatGPT is (1), google search is (2) and from my understanding, these build on fundamentally different foundations. Sure, you could use models like GPT-3 to generate summaries of your findings, but without references to source material, you cannot trust their answers. From what I heard Google is working on something like ChatGPT, but with an underlying knowledge base. At least it makes a lot of sense given their search business and it the logical evolution of these chat interfaces.",
Reddit,"Think about what Google Search does when there's an obvious, known answer. An article talking directly about the question you had sits at the top of the results and possibly a curated knowledge graph panel.

Now think about what happens if it's obscure and there isn't really a good answer. You get unrelated sites or conspiracy theories.

ChatGPT is similar. If it doesn't know the answer, it spins fairy tales that sound plausible.",
Reddit,"The difference is the ux, not the tech. I had a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with chatgpt as a test, asking it how to build a fence in my backyard. It was able to walk me through what type of wood to use, how to set the posts, how to make sure it was level, what type of finish to use and, in the end, it even talked me into using a contractor with suggestions on how to find a trustworthy one, because it was able to ‚Äúsense‚Äù that this was beyond my skill level based on the questions I was asking.

Whether this sort of thing turns out to be a paradigm shift is yet to be seen, but people focusing on the tech itself are missing the bigger picture.",
Reddit,"So the original point was that ChatGPT (and OpenAI in general) will not challenge Google. Do you think that is the case and are you confident it will remain the case for, say, at least 50 years? 

>The difference is the type of memory, though. GPT's memory is extremely lossy. It only remembers what got reinforced thousands of times or what it can reconstruct through statistically likelihood. It is exactly like ChatGPT forgets and misremembers

I believe you, I just think you could write the same thing but replace ""ChatGPT"" with ""human""!

>The AI has no common sense or understanding. It tries to fake what it saw during training.

Right, but Google works that way too. It doesn't understand the articles it presents to you, it just runs an algorithm and orders web results in what it thinks is the most useful order. 

I know I'm being downvoted because it comes across like I'm hating on Google or something, I'm really not, I just like both companies. I think OpenAI and ChatGPT are exciting and useful. I've already replaced some of my Google searches with a ChatGPT search first and a Google search second if I don't get a good answer. But I think we'll still need to be able to search the web for results and have an AI sort the results into a useful order. I think we need both, but I think OpenAI will be used alongside Google in the future and will take a not insignificant proportion of searches to answer them first.",
Reddit,"This guy was never an executive at google. His LinkedIn says he was a senior software engineer, that‚Äôs 2 levels above entry level software engineer at Google.",
Reddit,"It is very cool technology, but I wish it could cite its sources when providing facts.  ie, if you ask it to write an essay about the rise and fall of the roman empire, it can absolutely do that, but you have no idea which are facts and which it made up. Makes it really hard to know if you can trust the information its putting out without fact checking every single claim.",
Reddit,"A form of chatGPT can easily replace google for most things people use google for. ‚ÄúWhy do we have daylight savings time?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow many ounces in a gallon?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy did WW2 start?‚Äù

Stuff like that, chatGPT is already providing way better answers than google.",
Reddit,"I have actually asked chatgpt a lot of questions that it answered way better and way faster than Google.

i always have one chatgpt window open and sometimes i only get an answer from chatgpt because Googles answers are sometimes very bloated",
Reddit,"That's a lame excuse from Google. A lot of complex Google searches would be replaced with ChatGPT (or similar services).

Want to know if your doctor's office is open now, search on Google. Looking for a fix to your coding bug, use ChatGPT.",
Reddit,"> Think about it for probably 90% of your questions you enter into a search engine, then you spend most of the time getting the links, skipping over the promoted ones, clicking on two or three ad farm content farm links , before you find one that is in the ballpark of what you want. Not exactly efficient.

The promoted links are an intentional design decision. It is *against* Google‚Äôs commercial interests to have you skip over them because it‚Äôs how they generate income, so a chat interface *might* replace ‚ÄúFeeling Lucky‚Äù or be integrated into search in some other way but the ads will still turn up there ü§∑

Unfortunately, the content farm links might even be more pervasive as these language models and chat interfaces become easier to access and operate.",
Reddit,"I'm not sure what you are referring to with ""ChatGPT."" However, it is true that there are many challenges and hurdles to overcome in order to develop a search engine that can effectively compete with established platforms like Google Search.  
One of the main challenges is the need to have a large and comprehensive index of web pages and other content, as well as the ability to effectively rank and present relevant results to users. Google has spent many years and resources building its index and ranking algorithms, and it is continuously working to improve and refine them.  
Another challenge is the need to have a user-friendly interface and a seamless user experience. Search engines need to be easy to use and navigate, and they need to be able to handle a wide range of queries and return relevant results quickly.  
Finally, search engines also need to be able to handle a variety of languages and countries, as well as handle different types of content such as images, video, and maps.  
Overall, it is a significant undertaking to develop a search engine that can compete with established platforms like Google Search, and it requires significant resources and expertise.",
Reddit,I think Google also has its AI...ChatGPT is great to shake up things. Competition is good.,
Reddit,"There is an extension that can assist you in displaying ChatGPT responses alongside the search results from Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Maybe you should try it: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chatgpt-for-search-engine/feeonheemodpkdckaljcjogdncpiiban/related?hl=en-GB&authuser=0",
Reddit,Google exec: stop using chatGPT or I‚Äôm gonna jump in this pool.,
Reddit,Is this like the time the Nokia exc said the iPhone was a fad that would die out soon?,
Reddit,"ChatGPT was trained with materials it retrieved from the internet at a particular moment in time. If ChatGPT would regularly crawl the internet like Google‚Äôs web crawlers do, it could function as a search engine. The thing it brings to the table is semantic search. It can understand what you are looking for based on implicit meaning over the corse of a conversation. This is something Google is not good at.",
Reddit,"Yes, and I tested by asking them about unfamiliar names (but familiar in particular interest groups) and the AI said that their result is based on the training data set (in this case, I use: Meatball, Becomefun, Rorojump, Lapatata. Only Lapatata isn't an artist in this list, btw) and didn't attempt to search from the web

Also, they misunderstood the term ""artist"" as ""singer"" and the result gave me singers, and not artists in a sense of drawing",
Reddit,"I agree that is an advantage of Chatgpt. But google is also doing this right now for a lot of things. For instance I always search for ‚Äúufc tonight‚Äù on google when I know there are fights on. Google itself then displays all the fights. No need to click a link. They do this for other things, like asking a definition, too.  But with Chatgpt there is now finally a potential competitor to google. It will be interesting to watch how it develops",
Reddit,"I find ChatGPT's capability to understand user requests and to generate content quite impressive, but I would never trust it with knowledge questions.

It was already shown that ChatGPT will simply and confidently give wrong answers to questions. 

So, when I need to validate the output anyway, by googling, I can just continue to use Google in the first place. 

ChatGPT won't destroy Google, it does not even come close to Google's capabilities when it comes to finding information. But part of ChatGPT's functionality could greatly improve search engines.",
Reddit,"ChatGTP + knowledge graph maybe, but OpenAI doesn't publicly have anything like knowledge graph and Google does publicly have systems like ChatGTP. My money is on Google here",
Reddit,"No, some language model with the same capabilities as ChatGPT but with the reliability and knowledge of Google will replace Google. And there's a very good chance it will be made by Google.",
Reddit,"I decided to give ChatGPT a try and asked it to list a couple of court cases related to a certain topic, at first I was really impressed because it listed a couple of cases and a description for each and why they were relevant to the topic I had asked about. 

Then I Googled the cases and it turns out all of them were non existent. ChatGPT had completely confidently made up cases and their content and presented them as real cases. 

While I‚Äôm not saying ChatGPT is useless now or won‚Äôt be useful in the future. I‚Äôm just saying that **right now** I wouldn‚Äôt trust it to look things up.",
Reddit,"ChatGPT desperately needs to ramp up their back-end infrastructure, in order to be able to actually be available to be accessed reliably, on a regular basis.",
Reddit,"This is a pretty poor, uninformed take.

Google is a public company with an astronomical user base. The implications of them rushing to release an AI product, even in a state similar to Chat GPT3, are extremely high. Ethics, governance, regulations, etc would all be top of mind prior to releasing \*any\* mass market AI product.

It's also foolish to assume that Google doesn't already have something similar that's very far along in development, seeing as AI and machine learning already power literally every product they own (which serve billions of users daily). Everyone's already forgetting the Lamba/sentient fiasco last year, which even then was already based off a pretty old release?",

I want to see multiple sources and viewpoints. I want search results to take me to interesting websites that will answer my question.

Each year we get farther from the ideal of a decentralized democratic internet.",

Reddit,"The DoJ and its antitrust suit are a far bigger threat to Google than an AI Startup IMO. Not criticism of CGPT, it's pretty impressive to me.",
Reddit,"That doesn't make it useless, though. I've taken questions to it that I was having trouble answering on Google, and it at least pointed me in the right direction. So Google is useful for fact-checking its wrong answers, but ChatGPT can still sometimes generate answers that I wasn't finding on Google.

Whether it's a threat to Google depends, I guess, on how much people care about getting the right answer.",
Reddit,"Sometimes the opposite is true too though. Google gears itself towards the most search engine optimized result, not necessarily the correct result or ideal result. ChatGPT is in its' infancy, and will continue to improve over time. One of the main critiques is the inability to cite sources and no doubt they will work towards that end as part of the feedback of the public trial. 

Google will develop something similar and likely comparable, maybe even better. And search engines will always exist at least in the near future. But I do believe there come a time in the near distant future where we lean more heavily on AI than a search engine to answer a lot of our questions. The ability to get an answer and ask follow-up questions is an amazing feature and likely will be the additional feature that pushes the scale between the two for a normal user. 

But that is speculation, we'll see in time.",
Reddit,Agreed. ChatGPT is a cocky know it all until it‚Äôs answers are challenged and then it back-peddles. Kinda like a bad girlfriend.,
Reddit,"I don't remotely trust Google's ability to give correct answers. Those little preview answers that they give are fine maybe if you are looking at restaurant reviews, but I was googling my cat's diagnosis and I clicked on the top one and the article was some fake website with either an AI generated bullshit or cobbled together paragraphs from various other veterinary websites which contain enough terms to trick the algorithm. The entire discussion oscillated between different diagnoses and made no sense. In one sentence it would talk about liver failure in the next kidney failure and then in the next it would talk about cancer and at one point it was actually discussing dogs not cats.

I've also found even simple things like when did x tv show come out to be incorrect instead giving the date it's on Netflix, instead of the date it was released in the 1970s. And every time I Google movie name streaming, I get a link to either Disney, Netflix, or Hulu, despite the fact that none of those services actually have the movie. If you go to just watch and search the movie you will discover it's streaming on Amazon prime, or not actually streaming anywhere at all but you can rent it or buy it from Amazon or Apple.",

Reddit,ChatGPT is the better experience,
Reddit,"But isn't the current model also based on ""knowledge""? 

I do not think that the input is the problem. 

I think ""the AI"" itself the ""problem"". 

I think if we want to have trustworthy results from an AI system, we need a lot AIs, that are all limited in scope, highly specialized on their subject and built/monitored by a team of experts. 

For example a law AI that would be built with input from law experts/lawyers/judges and monitored by a team of the same people. 

It would then be rented to law firms and used by lawyers, who would be able to spot mistakes in the output. 

This would be used to lessen the workload on the individual lawyer, so that the law firm can service the same amount of clients with less lawyers, or to overcome a shortage of professionals on the labor market.",
Reddit,"The person missed the main point. Right now chatGPT cannot scale to what Google does. Not even google can right now. Being able to scale cheaply and efficiently is what's going to determine if it sinks google or not. 


Google knows this and has invested heavily into designing custom chips that specialize in transformers. If Google can scale and beat openai to a full product, Google will crush chatgpt. It is so entrenched  in people's lives that google could integrate it into Android /iphone where assistant will be your chatgpt and google can use GCP to scale ultra cheaply with their custom chips.",
Reddit,"Well, to start with, Google definitely has something like it *already.* Remember [this guy](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-engineer-claims-ai-chatbot-is-sentient-why-that-matters/)?

Yeah, so fucking what.  Xerox completely missed the boat on GUI.  Google could completely miss the boat on this.  So far they've shown a very deeply ingrained inability to monetize anything except ads, so it doesn't really look that good for them.",
Reddit,"> And yeah I agree it can do things google can't, it can generate great texts, inputs, conversations.. it was trained exclusively for conversational engagements google is just raw data

Sure, what I'm getting at is that even for Google Search's main thing of looking up the answers to factual questions, it has a massive edge.

Google has an opportunity to build something better -- they clearly already have similar tech, so combine that with Search and their whole Knowledge Graph thing to try to fact-check the chatbot output... but that might be harder than it sounds. And Google isn't the only search engine, so there's no guarantee that they'll get there first.

ChatGPT *as it is today* isn't a risk to Google, as you really have to use them together if you want factual answers. But that could change very quickly.
