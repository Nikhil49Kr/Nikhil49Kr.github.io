heavier pound steel pound paper,Future of jobs
chatgpt pound steel heavier pound paper pound unit weight defined force exerted object due gravity mass object measure amount matter contains typically measured kilograms grams,Future of jobs
density steel grams per cubic centimeter density paper varies depending type quality paper generally much lower density steel means given volume steel weigh volume paper example cubic foot steel weighs pounds cubic foot paper weighs pounds,Future of jobs
two objects weigh one pound object made steel much denser compact object made paper also difficult defo room crush due strength rigidity steel,Future of jobs
talking ass confidently gives wrong answer something simple explanation could fool someone paying attention curiously ask kilo bricks versus kilo feathers question gets right seen question online however completely failed transfer knowledge one situation continue questioning ask would like change answer first question based answer second says yes gets confused reverts justifor informationng old wrong answer rest transcript comment,Future of jobs
heavier kilogram bricks kilogram feathers,Future of jobs
chatgpt kilogram bricks kilogram feathers mass one kilogram would equally heavy weight measure force exerted object due gravity defined mass object multiplied acceleration due gravity kilograms unit mass weight weight object depends strength gravity location,Future of jobs
key difference kilogram bricks kilogram feathers density materials density measure much mass contained given volume bricks much denser feathers meaning higher mass per unit volume means given volume bricks weigh volume feathers,Future of jobs
example bag could hold one liter material kilogram feathers would take much larger volume kilogram bricks feathers less dense however bricks feathers would still mass one kilogram,Future of jobs
based answer would like change answer previous question pounds steel feathers,Future of jobs
pound unit weight mass defined force exerted object due gravity weight object equal mass multiplied acceleration due gravity acceleration due gravity constant value weight object directly proportional mass,Future of jobs
since density steel much higher density feathers pound steel much smaller volume pound feathers means pound steel compact difficult defo room pound feathers,Future of jobs
terms weight pound steel would heavier pound feathers higher mass however difference weight would significannot difference volume difference density steel feathers large difference density steel paper,Future of jobs
could also hung fact pound used lot different measurements kilogram always mass bricks example easy generalize steel one less,Future of jobs
