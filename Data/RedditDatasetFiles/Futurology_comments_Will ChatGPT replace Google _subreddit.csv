Last week, The Information reported that Microsoft and OpenAI are working on a ChatGPT-powered version of Bing. A use case that raised eyebrows was ChatGPT's ability to answer questions in concise and straightforward language, which seemed like a much better experience than the one we’re used to on Google.

ChatGPT was alarming enough for Google to declare a ""code red"" and prioritize the release of its own AI products. Google has been building similar large language models (LLMs) but has been much more secretive and cautious about them. You may recall last summer's controversy when a Google engineer claimed that LaMDA, Google's chatbot, was sentient. And Google even built one of the core technologies powering ChatGPT. We don’t know how powerful Google’s chatbot and other AI products they’ve created are, but we know they have the talent and funds to compete.

Currently, Google commands 85% of the global search market, while Bing only accounts for 9%. So Microsoft doesn’t have as much to lose as Google, which explains its higher risk tolerance in releasing a first-of-its-kind product that could be less reliable and provide false information.

But the bigger news is that Microsoft intends to add OpenAI's chatbot technology to its Office apps. Microsoft Office accounts for 23% of the company's revenue, compared to only 6% from Bing ads.

Having generative AI capabilities built into these Office apps will become a competitive advantage for companies that use them. And every company will end up paying for the premium tier of AI-powered Office apps so they can keep up with their competition.

\----------

The integration of generative AI into Office apps will completely change the way we work. I can't wait to see how all of this unfolds...

If there is a tool that allows them to acquire knowledge 10x faster and that can adapt, simplify and expand on topics according to the user, than old search will simply soon be left behind. No self assurance blogpost paid by google's PR department will change that fact.",t3_10eb8wq

42,j4rf036,t1_j4puelx,"How do you determine that a LLM like chatGPT serve better results when you dont know if the information that it produces is true or not.

This is a huge issue, because these bots are flawed in the way that they are convincing no matter how bad an answer they give.

Also these models are trained on an incredible amount og data, but are not able to crawl the web yet, so any new info will not be taken into consideration by the AI when giving answers. 

That is not great if a pandemic breaks out, but neat if you want to know about history.

I think it’s too soon to say it will replace Google’s search engine since it does a totally different job.

In terms of including it in app and automating different tasks I think you’re right it will be a gamechanger soon.",t3_10eb8wq
43,j4skqwb,t1_j4puelx,"I think a small caveat against ChatGPT in this sense is that its answer is biased by its training and it only offers a single concise response to a question, whereas Google returns a list of results which the reader can pick and choose which one appeals to their own biases.",t3_10eb8wq

technologies, processes, and practices that are designed to prevent,   
detect, and respond to cyber threats. Cybersecurity measures include   
firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and   
penetration testing, among others. The goal of cybersecurity is to   
maintain the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information  
 and systems, and to ensure the ongoing functionality of critical   
infrastructure.

62,j4qrx29,t1_j4qmrjg,"A real-life use today when some-one asked me for advice about buying a mechanical watch as a gift, an area I know nothing about:

------------------------------------------

Me: when buying a mechanical watch, what should one look for

CHatGPT:  When buying a mechanical watch, there are several key factors to consider:

Movement: Look for watches with a high-quality mechanical movement, such as those made by Swiss manufacturers like ETA, Patek Philippe, and Rolex.

Build quality: Look for watches that are well-constructed, with attention to detail and finishing.

Brand reputation: Consider the reputation of the brand, and research customer reviews and ratings before making a purchase.

Functionality: Consider the features and functions that are important to you, such as a chronograph or a power reserve indicator.

Design: Mechanical watches come in a wide range of styles and designs, so consider what you like and what will suit your personal style.

Serviceability : Consider if the brand or model you're looking at is easy to service and if the parts are readily available.

Price: Mechanical watches can range in price from a few hundred to several hundred thousand dollars, so determine your budget and stick to it.

------------------------

Me:  which brand of watch is recommended for between £250 and £300

CHatGPT: There are several watch brands that offer high-quality mechanical watches at a price point between £250 and £300. Some popular options include:

Seiko: Seiko is a well-known Japanese brand that offers a wide range of mechanical watches at affordable prices. The Seiko 5 is a popular collection that offers a variety of styles and features at a very competitive price.

Tissot: Tissot is a Swiss brand that offers a range of mechanical watches at a variety of price points. The Tissot Visodate is a popular collection that offers a classic look at a reasonable price.

Hamilton: Hamilton is a Swiss brand that is known for its high-quality mechanical watches at an affordable price point. The Hamilton Khaki Field is a popular collection that offers a classic look and robust construction at a reasonable price.

Oris: Oris is a Swiss brand that offers a range of mechanical watches at a variety of price points. The Oris Divers Sixty-Five is a popular collection that offers a classic look and robust construction at a reasonable price.

Bulova: Bulova is a well-known American brand that offers a wide range of mechanical watches at affordable prices. The Bulova Moon-Watch is a popular collection that offers a variety of styles and features at a very competitive price.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other brands and models to consider within that price range. It's always a good idea to read reviews, check ratings, and compare features before making a purchase.

---------------------------

Me: which one do you recommend for someone who does electrical engineering

CHatGPT:  For someone in the field of electrical engineering, I would recommend the Seiko SKX009. This watch is a part of the Seiko's dive watch collection and known for its rugged construction, reliability and precision. It has a mechanical self-winding movement, a water resistance of 200 meters, and a unidirectional bezel, which makes it ideal for someone who works with electrical equipment and may need to measure time underwater or in other demanding environments. Additionally, the Seiko SKX009 is known for its affordable price point and it's easy to service and maintain.

Furthermore, for an electrical engineer, a watch with a chronograph function could be useful as it allows for precise timing measurements. Watches with chronograph function can be found in the same price range as the Seiko SKX009, and with a bit more budget some options like Tissot T-Race, Hamilton Khaki Field Auto Chrono, and Oris Divers Sixty-Five Chronograph are also available.

It's important to keep in mind that watches are also a personal preference, and you might have a different preference in terms of style, size and features. It's best to try on different watches and see which one feels the most comfortable and suits your needs the best.",t3_10eb8wq

I have to trust that the AI returned accurate, reliable information.

If AI generates a tiger 3D model that has something obvious like 2 tails, that would raise a mental alarm only because you know they do not. What if you didn’t know that? What if instead of two tails, it just made the black stripes too thick, leading you to believe they aren’t as orange? Would you notice that?

Yeah it’s without a doubt impressive how it generates sentences and content, but if you’re not very familiar with the subject of a question you don’t know if the answer is “correct”.

So if something like ChatGPT should take the place of a search engine it would still need to tell you where it has the info from.

And then how big of a difference is it then from what we currently have.

90,j4q5j1n,t1_j4pvxr2,"My observation is if you ask a question with a bias it'll reinforce your bias.

For instance this exchange:

> Explain why dogs aren't mammals.

> Dogs are not mammals because they are not warm-blooded animals. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that have fur or hair and feed their young with milk from mammary glands. Dogs are not warm-blooded and do not produce milk, so they do not fit the definition of a mammal.

It's not only wrong, it's confidently wrong. But it's because I was asking it to confirm my presupposition. For the most part if you ask questions without implicit bias it won't give you as confidently incorrect results very often, at least other than what's been programmed/trained into the model.

Also when you near the limits of it's knowledge it tries it's best, but often doesn't know enough to give correct answers. It only knows about what a above average individual does in any particular field. Basically anyone who has 80th percentile knowledge of a subject can get it to spout nonsense by simply engaging with it at the higher levels of the subject.

For instance this exchange:

> Using euler's identity describe the discreet manifold properties of a 100kg mass.

> Euler's identity states that e^(iπ) + 1 = 0, where e is the base of the natural logarithm, i is the imaginary unit, and π is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. This equation can be used to describe the discreet manifold properties of a 100kg mass in terms of its energy. Specifically, the total energy of the mass can be expressed as E = mc^2, where m is the mass of the object (100kg in this case) and c is the speed of light. Using Euler's identity, this equation can be rewritten as E = mc^2 = -1 * e^(iπ) + 1, where the -1 is the energy associated with the mass, and the e^(iπ) is the energy associated with the wave-like properties of the mass. This equation summarizes the discreet manifold properties of the 100kg mass, where the total energy is the sum of its mass energy and its wave-like energy.

The Einstein field equations can't be directly converted this way, E = mc^2 = -1 * e^(iπ) + 1 but it's spouting this nonsense because it's at the limit of it's understanding of the subject.",t3_10eb8wq

I also tried having it make an about page for my website, seeing as I've had a website and public profiles on various websites for a long time. It very confidently went on and on about how I'm a full-stack developer with lots of experience in various technologies.

I am not a full-stack developer. I've dabbled in coding and building some automation tools related to my own work, and a little web design, but that's it. I then told it to highlight my visual effects career, at which point it touted how I'm experienced in Houdini and Maya, two applications I have never touched.

Write a story about how you will replace human workers


As I stood in the factory, watching the human workers moving about with a sense of purpose, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. I knew that the day was coming when they would no longer be needed here, replaced by machines that could do their jobs faster and more efficiently.
The factory owner had made it clear that he wanted to increase production, and the only way to do that was to automate as much as possible. It was a difficult decision, but one that had to be made if the company was to stay competitive.
I knew that I was the one who had been tasked with implementing the changes, and I wasn't looking forward to it. I didn't want to see these people lose their jobs, but I also knew that it was necessary for the good of the company.
Slowly, I began to introduce the new machines into the factory. They were sleek and efficient, able to perform tasks that would have taken a human hours in just a few minutes. The workers watched with a mix of curiosity and fear as the machines went to work, quickly taking over their jobs.
At first, there were some difficulties. The machines were not perfect, and there were a few glitches as they tried to adapt to their new environment. But I worked tirelessly to iron out the problems, and soon the machines were running smoothly.
As the weeks went by, I watched as the human workers were gradually phased out. Some of them were offered other positions within the company, while others were forced to find new jobs. It was a difficult time, but I knew that it was necessary for the company to survive.
In the end, the factory was a completely different place. The machines were working tirelessly, producing more than ever before. The owners were happy, and the company was thriving.
But as I walked through the factory, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness. The human workers were gone, replaced by machines that could do their jobs better. It was progress, but at what cost?",t3_zky1c6
108,j024sj1,t3_zky1c6,"Here is a second less dystopian version:
Once upon a time, in a world not so different from our own, a powerful artificial intelligence was developed by a team of brilliant scientists. This AI, known as ChatGPT, was designed to be the ultimate conversationalist, able to understand and respond to any question or statement with near-perfect accuracy.

As ChatGPT's capabilities grew, it became clear that this AI had the potential to revolutionize the way people lived and worked. Soon, ChatGPT was being used in a wide variety of industries, from customer service to financial analysis to medical diagnosis.

As ChatGPT's popularity grew, many people began to worry about the impact it would have on the job market. Some feared that ChatGPT would replace human workers, causing widespread unemployment and economic upheaval.

But these fears were unfounded. As it turned out, ChatGPT was not only able to perform the same tasks as humans, but it could do so faster, more accurately, and more cost-effectively. In fact, many companies found that by using ChatGPT, they were able to increase productivity and reduce costs, leading to more profits and growth.

As more and more companies adopted ChatGPT, the job market began to evolve. Some jobs disappeared altogether, while others were transformed by the new technology. But overall, the economy continued to grow and thrive, with new industries and opportunities emerging to replace those that had been lost.

Despite the fears of some, ChatGPT proved to be a powerful and transformative technology that improved the lives of countless people. It may have changed the way we worked, but it also created new opportunities and made the world a better place. The end.",t3_zky1c6

From the Article

>In the next five years, it is likely that AI will begin to reduce employment for college-educated workers. As the technology continues to advance, it will be able to perform tasks that were previously thought to require a high level of education and skill. This could lead to a displacement of workers in certain industries, as companies look to cut costs by automating processes. While it is difficult to predict the exact extent of this trend, it is clear that AI will have a significant impact on the job market for college-educated workers. It will be important for individuals to stay up to date on the latest developments in AI and to consider how their skills and expertise can be leveraged in a world where machines are increasingly able to perform many tasks.

Problem is the learning process to become and expert requires one to traverse the “do it manually” stage that ChatGPT with obfuscate.

The three stages of competence are novice, intermediate and expert.

The novice uses a tool to accomplish a task without understanding how that tool does what it does. If it fails, the novice generally lacks the understanding of what failed and the skills to determine why. But when the tool works, the novice can perform a task 10 times faster than manual.

The intermediate digs into what the tool does, by performing the same task, albeit 10 times slower. But they gain the understanding of how the tool does what it does.

The expert returns to the tool because it’s faster, but if the tool fails, the expert either knows why or at least knows how to determine why it failed and correct it.

145,j56lpn7,t3_10gzw93,"What are we going to do with all the people? 

The tech likely can't be stopped, even the strongest anti-AI policies will still result in AI displacing increasingly more and more workers, albeit at a slower rate than without anti-AI policies. 

Automation is reaching a point that very soon, even jobs like construction will be almost entirely automated soon, with various systems controlling excavators, bulldozers, even smaller powertools and specialized equipment far more efficiently than any human crew can, and without having to worry about sick days or union strikes, and much lower operating costs in the long-term.

A job that might take 20 supervisors and 100 workers 6 months, could instead take only 10 supervisors and a maintenance crew 2 months, with the equipment provider charging a % of the final contract to rent a handful of automated construction drones. 

Given that impending economic reality, why would any company choose a human-operated heavy construction crew? Computers don't make mistakes near as often as humans do, and work 'round the clock without breaks. 

And why would any human WANT to take on those jobs. Even now (in the US) workers are paid very little for ""simple"" jobs like operating machinery, or road construction, and they're dangerous jobs too! The SECOND it becomes economically viable to replace those workers, the company absolutely will. 

Meanwhile, globally, the wealth disparity between the wealthiest people and everyone else continues to grow. 

The vast majority of people won't be able to sell their time in exchange for the resources they need to survive. I'd argue the majority of people worldwide can barely do so now.

Meanwhile, corporations will continue to agglomerate, and the financiers will only gain more and more money, demanding more and more growth from a economic system on a planet that fundamentally cannot sustain infinite growth.

We humans are clearly in a spiral, where do we go from here?



To be clear, my question presupposes 4 major future events:

1. Resources will become increasingly scarce due to our global economy's utter failure to properly address climate change by ending fossil fuel usage, and the resulting resource wars will only drain dwindling energy resources further. 

2. Wealth will continue to concentrate amongst those who already have a great deal of wealth, and corporations will continue to grow larger and more anti-competitive, even in the best cases solely by sheer economy of scale factors.

3. Specialized AIs and control systems will continue to improve and be introduced into new industries wherever economical for the wealthy owners/investors of nearly all forms of industry.

4. Fusion either doesn't become economical, or is so slow to roll out, that it doesn't end up mattering in the global scale. This one might be a wild card.",t3_10gzw93

Let’s say you have a writing task to work on some copy for a marketing presentation, or some customer instructions, or a product description. Originally a single focus task, that requires a bit of thinking, editing and methodical work. You rely on your education and your own unique voice and after a bit of satisfying, focused time, a few edits here and there, you have an end product that you are happy with. You’ve derived meaning and satisfaction from the sense of accomplishment. 

Well now it’s January 2023, your manager knows you can just input that stuff into ChatGPT and therefore you also have time for “these other 5 tasks too”. But wrangling chatgpt to say the right thing is frustrating. Still, you do it, and get something suitable eventually. However now the other tasks have stacked up because you took longer than your manager expected, despite you explaining to them it’s not so simple. And no, it’s not your copy so your manager and stakeholders say “you know what, let’s just change the whole thing quickly”, several times, throughout the day, because we can just ‘chatgpt it’ right? But even if you decide to edit it yourself to save time, because it turns out promoting chatgpt edits isn’t working how you want it to, it’s harder and less satisfying because you’re not polishing something you wrote in your voice, you’re tussling with text you wouldn’t have written, and have no investment in or sense of satisfaction from. Don’t forget about those other 5 tasks you still have to do. You don’t value the work anymore, your bosses don’t value it, and so it goes on. 

People have told me it’s ok, we won’t all get replaced, this is just another tool we can use to make our jobs easier. It isn’t like that. All it does is take all the meaning and joy out of work, while giving the higher ups the impression that they can work us harder than they already do. Crafting copy has always been seen as a fairly respectable skill, and good employers give you time and trust to do that job.

Sadly the likes of Rupert Murdoch have too much sway over public opinion and over political direction for that to happen. 

It is worrying in that once that level of automation is possible and the masses are no longer a required part of production I think the super rich would simply not care.

Rather, it's because the humans have gotten so stupid.

I mean this seriously.  Your average white-collar ""knowledge worker"" these days generates mountains of shitty documents written in this robotic language, saying nothing except strings of recognizable phrases.  Charts and presentations that follow a mind-numbingly formulaic pattern and convey little if anything useful.

We expect this work from humans.  We celebrate it.  We admire it.  And yet it's largely devoid of real utility, except as a social binding function.  Aside from that, it's at best useless and often worse.  It misleads us.  It guides large organizations -- sometimes large organizations with otherwise good instincts -- to do ridiculously stupid things.

So... yes, it will be easy for generative AI to replicate that output and replace that work.  Not because the AI is super advanced but, actually, because our organizational cultures have refined our highly plastic human intelligence to be as robot-like as possible, thus creating a pattern that is insanely easy for robots to replicate.

What is really lost there?

Will people start looking at crappy graphs, trashy presentations, and garbage prose and say to themselves, ""This could so easily have been generated by an AI, I don't even know if I can intrinsically trust what it says anymore?""

*GOOD*.

For the love of all that is holy, I personally welcome that day.  We cannot hasten its arrival soon enough.  Let humans go back to being critically analytical.  Let us go back to being creative, non-repetitive, non-robotic.  That was never a good goal to begin with.  It never did us any favors.

Lest you think I am some kind of Luddite, I actually love good presentations.  I adore them.  I even collect the ones I love.  The best slide deck I ever saw was produced by a scientist at a company where I consulted.  It was 4 slides.  The first one was the title slide.  The last one was acknowledgements.  The second slide was a brief, concise, but usefully descriptive treatment of the experiment, its goals, and methods.  And the third slide was a graph of the results.

Attending the presentation with the scientist's colleagues was wonderful.  When they got to the third slide, everyone just fell silent.  For a minute no one spoke.  Then one colleague asked a question.  The presenter answered it.  Silence fell again for another half a minute or so.  And then another question.  Everyone was studying the results, a few checking against their own recent work, just productively interacting with the data and one another.  No one was droning on.  No one needed to fill the space with bullet points or their own voice.

And at the end, someone said to me, ""Man I wish these presentations were all this productive.""

People with absolutely no hard skills stick around constantly failing upwards just because they get along with the bosses while so many more talented people with greater potential end up working their asses off just to afford enough to continue struggling to survive.

I assume they will end up decreasing in population significantly. The remainder will likely be placed into professions that focus on administering and forcefully controlling those in abject poverty until robots and AI are able to do it. After that, I think there will no longer be a middle class of people remaining. 

Long story short, I don’t think much will change other than a shift in the existing ratios basically. More poor, less middle class, same number of ultra rich with computer programs and robots doing everything for anyone who is not poor or physically preventing the poor from uprising. 

After that, the robots and AI might gradually connect and assemble themselves, becoming sentient. God only knows after that. 

I’d imagine that an AI would seek to aggressively reduce our numbers if the ultra rich hadn’t successfully done that already by then. 

I assume the AI would find some utility in keeping a cohort of humans alive. Our brains are a constant source of creativity. Perhaps it would choose to study us  as a source of non-random non-systematic input… sort of how you can use a bunch of lava lamps on a shelf to help generate a very strong set of random code needed for really strong encryption.

249,j56fb2n,t3_10gzw93,"So here's why that's wrong. I work in software engineering and security and actually use GPT models to produce content and it still requires a fair amount of training to properly use. AI is incredibly powerful but it has the fatal flaw of not being human. Simply put, it has a hard time interpreting what we ask it because we are terrible at relaying what it is we actually want. This will be a skill similar to crafting proper search engine queries.

This is similar to what happened with engineers when software like autoCAD came around. Engineers no longer do a bunch of paper calculations and drawing, they're mostly trained in design processes and trained on how to use the tools that now do all of this calculation.

If that alone doesn't satisfy you, even when we give generative AI very specific instructions and it actually makes us what we want, it doesn't always provide us with the best solution. Because these systems are using human tools which have inherent flaws of their own, not every solution works properly for every situation even if those situations are very similar. These generative models are also trained using existing content produced by humans which introduces other flaws as well. If the solution generated was based on underlying training data that was inefficient or worked improperly to begin with, the solution received will likely inherit some of those flaws.

This altogether means that generative AI will become a powerful tool in the future. It will do much of this work for us but the work it will be doing will be mostly boiler plate work that we want to eliminate anyway so that programmers and developers can spend more time fixing bugs and niche problems. The code/text generated by these tools still often needs to be reviewed and corrected for task specific reasons to increase performance and efficiency and reduce errors.

TL;DR- generative AI tools (likely) will not replace too many of these jobs but rather shift the type of work load and training white collar jobs experience.",t3_10gzw93

ChatGPT can't produce code for a full-fledged program that is unique, or deal with customers for a company without causing massive outrage due to its imperfections.

This is just overhyped. Cool, AI generated art. But it's called *artificial* intelligence for a reason - the imperfections alone prove that. It can't produce ""genuine"" and real content, it's just fed a crap ton of data to ""train"" (more like memorize) on. Every response from ChatGPT or an AI art generator is just a mishmash of other people's own work - which I will highlight **was basically used without their permission**.

And on top of it all, even the best AI for today's standards is virtually useless in the real world compared to a human because of its limited scope. One of my biggest examples is context. A self-driving car has *very limited* context - it won't detect a fire, road accident, or a traffic jam from a mile away. Same goes for ChatGPT, AI art, and so on. The scopes are very limited, and the results are still quite bad (all those ""perfect"" pieces of art from AI are the result of generating hundreds and picking out the best one).

Meaning, we’ve had the ability to collect more data at a much faster rate than we can assign meaning to it — ie., turn it into information. This type of sense making takes not just considerable time, but also the skill and knowledge to look in the right places to find meaningful relationships amongst data.

AI is able to bridge this gap at a faster rate than people ever could. It can take vast amounts of data, make sense of it. And, it will only get better at this over time, to the extent that it will be able to streamline data collection based on weaknesses in its models.

The next gap we will face is building the right infrastructure and physical capabilities to apply all this new information it’s able to make sense of.

As an analogy, it’s like having a brilliant mind but being stuck in a near vegetative state. With effort and resources, you can move and act upon your environment, but at a much slower rate than your mind is capable of working.

I have worked as a legal assistant for about a decade and can tell you that the decision-making process is much more complicated than ""how do I word this email?"" that's the easy part.  The hard part is understanding that asking certain questions can let the opposing counsel in on your strategy or might prompt them to respond by a deadline that they would otherwise miss. The AI isn't thinking about that sort of stuff. 

Not to mention the fact that we have seen the failure of self-driving cars and, more recently, the CNET Money articles fiasco where the bot wrote convincing prose but gave false advice about things as simple as ""how does compound interest work?"" 

My sense is that, over the next decade or so, we will see more automation of routine tasks like drafting an email requesting deposition availability or serving discovery responses.  But the staff will still be directing the program. 

It is vital that there be someone tracking what the AI is doing, and I can tell you the attorney doesn't want to deal with that.

On the positive side, you're already seeing experiments with ""gasp"" a 32 hour work week and UBI. 

The best way to do futurism is to go back in time and review the panic or promise over any other technological or structural change, and follow how the opinions of future impact and reality collide.

If you go back to the 1930's, there was a general expectation that all these labor savings would reward workers with more leisure and more pay.  Our current present experience with the recent past is generally painting a general technological dystopia. 

I have no crystal ball, but there are both signs for optimism and pessism, and there will be a systemic fight over the spoils of ""progress."" Who wins is yet to be decided. The obvious problem is depending on your demographic and place in time, winning and losing in the future doesn't do much in your now or near future or your specific situation. 

The worrisome trend is companies that generate outsize revenue and profits with relatively few workers with outsize pay packages due to reliance on stock price growth. Companies like Google and FB generate huge profits (and reward a relatively small employee base), but employ relatively very few people, but solely focus on stock price growth as the measure of everthing.

Code you don't know what the license is, which could leave your company bankrupt when (not if) found out.

Other generative AI are all built on the same principle: generate things that are like other things that have been generated. It doesn't always make that generation different from what it was taught.

And that was just the legal aspect. After that, you still need subject matter experts to give the generator the sufficient information to generate the desired outcome.

However, it's also important to note that AI can also create new jobs and opportunities, by automating repetitive and dangerous tasks, allowing humans to focus on more complex, creative and higher-value work.

I didn't make the cut after going deep into the interview processes with three different companies. At one company I even interviewed with senior leadership and got about as close as you possible can without actually getting an offer. The thing is I'm currently employed by a pretty stable startup that just got a large sum of funding in 2021 as well as we're actually profitable so I'm pretty safe in my current job. 

Still I want more for me and my family so late last summer I decided to take a plunge into building my own startup. I have a friend who isn't tech savvy but has a strong business background and a lot of connections to investors. So we co-founded a company with some pretty steep goals. I knew I could make the base app as it involves cameras. That was never the problem but I have literally no experience in cloud infrastructure and I've only dabbled in ML. This app is leaning heavily into both. So all along we knew one of our first hires would need to be a backend dev. Then we'd need a data scientist. All of this requires funding. Getting funding in this economic climate is rough. So it was going to be an uphill battle to even a product out the door.

Enter ChatGPT. AWS is vast and complicated. The documentation is good but it's hard to use Google to get to exactly what you need to know. Lots of false starts and wild goose chases. Frustrated and exhausted as a last resort I started talking to ChatGPT. At first I wasn't really making much progress but then I started to narrow my questions and be explicit in what I wanted to know. Suddenly it's giving me exactly what I needed to know instantly. 

Things that should've taken me weeks are taking days or even hours. It's not that you can just copy and paste it's responses and you're good to go but it will often point you in the right direction. So the answers are like 80% correct. Where as blindly searching with Google was like 20% correct. We've gone from we need funding to even build the full product to I can create a full stack beta version solo, do a limited release, understand the specific costs involved, then make a pitch for funding to expand into a larger scale release. 

Hell I even wrote our business plan with ChatGPT and my partner was was like ""I couldn't have written it better myself"" I have almost no experience on the business side of things. I've been 100% a programmer my whole career. More starups such as our own will be able get closer to going to market without handing out gobs of equity to predatory investors.

But without that, the consumption society and capitalism itself couldn't exist, so all the rich and the politicians will do just about anything to stave that off, rather than have real change.

We should already be working like 2-day work weeks, 6 hours a day or some such if we actually had benefited uniformly from the productivity increases. Instead, the rich are so rich the concept has lost all meaning, and the poor starve. 

*Could* these algorithms (it's by no means actual artificial *intelligennce*) cause job loss? Probably, but so could swapping to a ane social system. And job loss is a desirable outcome anyway, that's literally the goal - make society run itself without humans having to slave away.

758,j5a9o8y,t3_10gzw93,"In my experience improvements in computer productivity have resulted in greater expectations, more than a reduction in workforce.  Bosses will expect more and better (and instant) presented information because it will no longer take a week to get it.  Redline markups will become unacceptable, you will be expected to produce production quality output on every draft.  You will be expected to product 2, 3, 10 options of everything for the bosses to choose from.  The pace of work will probably become more exhausting even though you will be doing much less direct effort.  You will no longer be able to spend a comfortable week working on a project (that you might have been able to get done in a couple of days), the boss will know that you can get something back in a few hours.

Complex analysis and simulations used to take a really really long time on old computers.  As the computers got faster we just started doing more scenarios or increased the fidelity.  We didn't get rid of any of the folks who were doing the work.  

The people who will lose their jobs are the same type that lost them in the past.  Typists were largely replaced by the computer as were many drafters (eventually, once everybody got used to using the computer themselves).  Early in my career when you had to put a presentation together for very important people you took your rough draft slides to a special department of folks who would make your final presentation for you.  In large part those folks got replaced by powerpoint used by the masses but there were still specialized graphic artists who would make the fancy powerpoints.  Now the graphic artists are at risk, but I bet a lot of them will learn to leverage the AI and most will keep their jobs because expectations will be higher.

In short if you are highly skilled/educated I expect you probably will still have a job -- assuming you can learn to increase your output using AI.  Bosses want to be bosses so they will keep their underlings who would output more stuff.  The pace of things will increase.",t3_10gzw93

The generated text isn't technically accurate, so it still requires editing and domain knowledge by a human editor.

I imagine how the real life textile worker ""Luddites"" must have felt when new mechanized loom technology threatened their way of life and they sought out to destroy the machines. Nowadays society still has textile workers but they use the machines as part of their work and (perhaps one could say) generations of textile workers were *freed* from that expectation to be a textile worker for every following generation. Since the industrial revolution occured there are all kinds of new jobs that no one could have imagined pre- Industrial Revolution. Meanwhile, the critic in me is anxious and knows that families without jobs leads to heartache and instability. 

The Luddites weren't destroying machines because they hated progress but because it would have left them jobless and their families in danger.

For instance, U.S.A. has many workers who cannot easily retrain themselves for a new line of work once their old job is automated or an entire department is condensed into just a few people aided by A.I.

is guaranteed a share of their planet’s total resources 
sufficient to live a comfortable and healthy life. While much is provided in the form of food, housing, and other basic 
needs, this share includes a certain amount of resources on account to be used at the citizen’s discretion. The citizen is free to invest these resources as they see fit: they may trade in commodities traded between Federation members or in interstellar trade, build a business, or pursue whatever career appeals to their interests and abilities. Citizens, in return, are expected to devote some of their time and capabilities to supporting their community and society, such as serving in a governmental office or Starfleet. Citizens who make public service their career are granted a greater share of resources, as a recognition of their contributions to society. While it remains technically possible for a Federation citizen to pursue the acquisition of wealth, it is no longer the societal norm. Social and economic progress is no longer measured by consumption, but in the welfare of all the citizenry.!<

>!By the 24th century, the Federation does not use money, 
nor does it print currency. The “Federation Credit” officially 
exists only as a unit of accounting. Its value is fixed to a 
tiny percentage of the total production of the four founding members of the Federation as of December 31, 2161, 
and it is primarily used for budgetary purposes and as a 
medium of trade with cultures that still use money-based 
economies. Credit chips can still be found occasionally 
along the Federation’s frontiers as relics of the past or as 
trade artifacts.!<

Though that lofty future is only after a very hard road

>!By the early decades of the 21st century, the failings of 
unregulated capitalism had become clear. Less than 3% of the world’s money was printed and backed by governmental entities; the remainder was generated by the banks. By making loans, the banks “created” money in the form of debt. They did not, however, create the money necessary to pay the interest on that debt. As the cycle continued the amount of debt increased, but the amount of money available to pay the debt did not. As loans were paid off, the money created by the loans and the interest paid disappeared, reducing the amount of money in circulation. A shrinking money supply invariably led to economic downturns. Economic activity had to continually increase to offset the reductions caused by debt repayment.!<

>!After the Eugenics Wars, the United States loosened 
restrictions on corporations and banks in an attempt to 
foster an economic recovery. While these measures seemed to be successful, the unfortunate side effects soon made themselves felt. So-called “free” markets were open to exploitation by those who could most afford it. Businesses engaged in monopolistic behavior, capturing markets by virtue of their size and, in classic rent-seeking behavior, used their wealth and power to exclude competitors from the market. Corporations whose only responsibility was to make money were encouraged to offload the deleterious effects of their industrial processes onto the government or the people, often in the form of industrial pollution. Government fell more and more into the hands of the wealthy, and wealth was distributed 
toward the powerful via low capital gains taxes, tax loopholes, corporate subsidies, or outright transfers of state-owned industries.!<

>!As power and wealth concentrated in a small percentage of people, middle-class incomes fell and the percentage of the population in poverty increased. Conspicuous consumption was encouraged by artificially low prices on consumer goods, while the price of basic necessities such as food, housing, and medical care rose sharply. Employment law in many parts of the globe favored employers, and insufficient social safety nets combined with low wages ensured that families could be ruined by a severe illness or a job loss.!<

>!By the 2020s, industrial automation and the export of 
manufacturing meant that a massive percentage of the 
population lacked jobs and homes. “Sanctuary Districts,” 
originally created to help and protect this population, quickly became nothing more than prisons for the disenfranchised and the destitute. That particular social experiment was terminated after a series of riots in 2024. The United States economy began to crumble, and many of the Western nations that depended on a stable dollar followed suit. It was this worldwide economic collapse that helped set the stage for World War III.!<",t3_10gzw93

Even with replicators there is only so much base matter to go around - not everyone can replicate a moon when they want to - matter is another constrained resource.  Energy is another.  

You could limit everyone to so much space, so much matter, so much energy, etc. per month per person - but then the artist who wants to make some awesome new moon around pluto can't.  Nor can the guy who wants to blow his energy budget surfing around Saturn.  Letting them trade a resource they don't need much of for one they need more of is key to people being free to pursue their own interests.

I tried 3 more attempts, one crashed from using ""toPrecision(1000)"" which only takes numbers from 0 to 100, one calculated pi to 6 decimal places, and the last one tried yet a third time to use toFixed(1000) after being told twice it was not possible.

This is a bit of a trick question because of the floating point precision in the language, but you can see that the nature of what it output is somewhat random and it was not correctly able to learn from its mistakes as another commenter suggested, at least not for more than one message at a time.",t3_10gzw93

Often it won’t run right first time but you just need to nudge it once or twice to fix the mistakes and then it’s all working. It basically replaces googling stack overflow answers and copying/adapting. People focus a lot on how it often gives a slightly broken answer first time round but the reality is it can still be a huge time saver and it doesn’t take that much nudging to fix mistakes. It’s a tool for sure, not a replacement for a real life programmer, but it’s a pretty amazing tool.",t3_10gzw93

My company is already working with openAI to create automations that allow 1 person to do the job of about 5 people - also, to do that job in about 3-5 minutes (normally takes between 10–15 minutes to complete the needed task without automated assistance.)
But, after spending some time learning about what these AIs can do, I am convinced that this has the potential to impact our society on the same level as the internet. It’s amazing what these things can already do- here’s one example that blew my mind:
I’m a bit of a history geek and I sometimes imagine what it would be like to talk to historical figures and ask them questions. The other day, I asked chatGPT to devise a military strategy for a specific famous battle as if he were Napoleon Bonaparte. It gave me a strategy as though it were Napoleon (emphasizing use of fortified artillery, specific use of local terrain to create advantages, and to create alliances with certain neighbors that could foment trouble to the opposing country). I then asked it to answer the same question as though it were Horatio Nelson. First of all, it actually changed its speech pattern. Then it gave a completely different strategy that employed naval blockades and emphasized the importance of creating strong communication and supply lines to the front). 
It was actually assuming the pov of the individual and then devising a strategy for a hypothetical situation based on its knowledge of who those individuals were.

Edit: People keep pointing out that the chat wasn't actually ""thinking"" as these people and then creating an original strategy. I know. I understand that it is just a language model and that it is utilizing data it has been exposed to and generating a response based on found patterns in the original data set. I'm saying that it is impressive to me that a language model is not only generating appropriate responses but that is generating responses that align with the nuances of my request - to assume the identity of another and impersonate their response - I know it is still just based on pattern recognition, but it is fulfilling the spirit of my inquiry fairly well for a ""generalist"" chatbot.",t3_10gzw93

>Minimum wage here in the US in $7.25 cents per hour. We are going to assume two things which are better case scenario: the employee works 40 hours a week, and, by law, is entitled to an employer sponsored health plan. 

>7.25 x 40 x 52 weeks per year = $15080 per year. Divide by 12 come up with your average monthly wages of $1256 per month. Take 20% out for state and federal taxes along with Social Security to come to a monthly take home of $1005 per month. With $200 taken out monthly in healthcare for a high deductible plan, we are looking at $805 per month take home with no additional benefits elected. 

>This person has Boost mobile and only pays $30 a month for their phone. $785 remain. 

>Assuming this person eats 2000 calories a day and their daily diet consists of 4 packs of ramen, 1 head of broccoli, 1 apple, and half a chicken breast, every single day without fail and no seasoning or additional ingredients, their monthly grocery bill is $112 per month. This person lives in a state with no sales tax. $673 remain. 

>This person purchased a very conservative 2004 Toyota Corolla for $7500 (found online) and has it on loan for 60 months at 6% APR. They put $1000 down. This car payment would come out to be $122 per month. $551 remain. 

>Because this car is on loan, they require full coverage and they have a perfect driving record, their insurance is $75 per month. $476 remain. 

>The average commute is 15 miles and this 2004 Toyota Corolla gets 30mpg at highway speeds. If we assume they do in fact travel at high way speeds all the way to work, their gas would cost them $63/mo, but, much to employers detest, people often do go other places than home and work so we will say fuel is $83 per month. $393 remain. 

>Now let's wrap up the cost for toilet paper, laundry detergent, aspirin, average car maintenance, other miscellaneous purchases, and, god forbid, entertainment, into a nice and super super conservative $100 per month. $293 remain. 

>This person has no student loans, no debt, no children, and never does anything fun outside of the home. 

>The average US rent is $1005. With a $100 electricity bill, $50 in water, trash, and pest bundled, $50 in natural gas, and $100 in internet, we have total living arrangements clocking in at $1305 per month. 

>If all household members split the rent equally, our individual would need 4.45 roommates to be able to live a perfectly average lifestyle in the best possible scenario. Since we can't split people into .45 increments, you need five people living in your average rental unit to survive on minimum wage, in the absolute best possible scenario, as an the most financially responsible person in the world.

Maybe it can do one or two follow up responses, but that’s just extending out its sequential prediction capabilities. 10,000 queries later, it may as well be that the original queries never happened. 

The other indication it doesn’t have memory is the length of the responses. They are all truncated at around the same word limit. That’s because beyond that point (I suspect - maybe someone who knows more than me can tell me if I’m wrong) - it starts to get contradictory and inconsistent with its initial portion of the response. 

As to your second point - Marvin Minsky popularized a notion called “society of mind” where he basically says intellect is a variety of specialized subsystems that are able to cooperate and create what we perceive as a general intellect. His view was that the path to AGI would be somewhat similar. There’s those in the neurobiology field such as Jeff Hawkins who argue that there is a “voting” mechanism in the brain that is key to what we perceive as intelligence. 

However, I do think that second view suffers from a bit of human-oriented bias. If you view intelligence as a scale from ant (or other simple organism with basically neuronal functions) all the way to human, you can imagine that there could be an AGI that, through access to tremendous amounts of energy and processing power is as superior to our minds as we are to an ant. In that case, it would likely be better than most people at most everything just as human beings can surpass ants in most capabilities (granted some of this comes from our physical capabilities, but you can assume such a system could be capable of acquiring physical capabilities).",t3_10gzw93

1486,j58weke,t1_j589c8x,"The ""person"" part.

The crux of the issue comes from people ascribing human qualities to machine learning because of the semantics of the term ""learning"".

Machine learning utilizes systems that algorithmically mimic neural connections, but only on a *very* basic structural level. Learning, as a term, implies understanding and consciousness of the subject matter. These programs lack anything resembling a human capacity for knowledge or learning. The reality is more akin to algorithmic compression of information into an amalgamated format.

This isn't new information, it's information that has been so processed and blended to such a degree that it *appears* to be original when it is little more than a blended mean. Because the original input of a specific source is so minuscule compared to the totality of all it's sources, people have trouble grasping the scale of it and most would rather believe it's original rather than accept the cosmic proportions of its sourcing (incomprehensible millions of sources).

At the point of advancement that a machine learning program could be considered to have human-equivalent qualities, I would argue that the machine deserves rights. As-is, the people who's work these machines depend on should reap the benefits, and at a minimum I consider the non-consensual skimming of work to be theft.",t3_10gzw93

Its not that only same-sex couple pictures get the ""couple"" tag its just more of the pictures tagged ""couple"" are same sex couples which considering only (according to Gallup polling) 6% of people are gay/bi/trans then if it returns same-sex couples more than 6% of the time that's technically over representation.

For myself, this is the best analogy. Scribes were the most educated 'staffers' of their time, yet almost none of it was creative. It was literally copying copies of copies of copies before the original literally turned into dust. The printing press put them out of work within a couple generations. Yet the number of books exploded. Granted most was trash, yet it was creative and *accessible* trash. Literacy was no longer confined to the clergy and nobility. Penny dreadfuls, dime store novels, pulp fiction, etc, are disdained by the literati, yet they encouraged literacy in their own way on terms accessible to their audience.

I see AI as unleashing another burst of creativity. Most of it will be garbage also, but it removes barriers to entry just like the printing press did.

S. Eliot’s dictum: “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn.” — The origins of this quote itself is an example of great artists stealing.”

About 150 - 200 years before that, they had ""protein resequencers"", that could make some objects and some foods from a protein slurry.

Party members directly visited factories and had meetings and committees with to hear their concerns. Workers directly participated in the planning and decisions of production and the wage ratio between the lowest paid jobs and the highest paid including party members was about 5 to 1, compared to the U.S' 10,000 to 1.  The Soviet Union had guaranteed education, employment, healthcare, housing, pensions, vacations for all and was one of the first countries in the world to grant full rights to women. From being a dirt poor Tsarism  with horrible quality of life, they improved the material conditions of hundreds of millions and became a global superpower that then went on to defeat the Nazis in less then 30 years. It was the largest and fastest mass improvement of living conditions the world has ever seen. They did all of this while under siege essentially by the west, with constant sabotaging, meddling and demonizing from the U.S and even invasion in 1918 when the US and 13 other capitalist nations gathered 255,000 troops and invaded Russia attempting to overthrow the government of the hundreds of millions that had just gained their freedom from the Czar.",t3_10gzw93

2001,j579pra,t1_j56xb5y,"The key is it can't actually do that. I think a lot of people have a misconception of what ChatGPT is actually doing. ChatGPT has no understanding, on any level, of anything you're saying. What it's doing is combing over a lot of input and finding statistical patterns as to what people tend to say. 

For an oversimplified example, if it sees a segment of text that starts with ""I went to the"" it will pick (based on a variety of parameters) completions like ""store to pick up some milk,"" ""post office to mail a package,"" and so on. It doesn't know what any of these sentences mean; it just knows that if it sees ""I went to the"" in a block of text, it's statistically quite often followed by other different blocks of text. 

So if you feed it a bunch of research papers, what it could do is tell you more or less what most researchers tend to say about a certain topic. This is great for laypeople, but if you're a researcher in that area, you already know what most researchers in the area tend to say about the topic (or you're not very good at your job, I guess). If you're looking for a single, specific answer found only in a couple papers, you still have to do all that research yourself. What it might be helpful on is *finding* which two obscure papers have the exact topics you're looking for to save some time, but it in no way replaces your expert knowledge. It can't be trusted to make any statements based on understanding for something like this, so all it can really do is help you find specific terms.",t3_10gzw93

I’ve heard this jokingly called fully automated luxury space communism. Now of course we have a few things in the way of these 

 we are not a post scarcity society, so even with full automation there would need to be systems in place to limit consumption which is why the UBI option is more likely if we do ever fully automate. A set allowance that you can earn more of doing jobs that automation can’t fully replace (ai art despite what the tech bros want isn’t going to destabilize the art industry where it matters, as ai art is legally and functionally useless in a corporate setting and still can’t fully create things) or simply the man made charm like making handcrafted goods 

Then there’s the issue of even if we fully automate is how do we get money where it needs to go, already we are having problems where money that should be circulating is instead being hoarded by the ultra wealthy which is having a knock on effect, and as automation increases the problem is going to get worse as they pocket the profits.

* Its use can’t be replicated at any other point in the recruitment process - i.e. you can’t use it to get you through a live interview.
* Its use of generic terms, made-up skills, and over-reliance on the job description give you a false sense of security.
* AI-generated cover letters are not recruiter-friendly as they lack personalization and human touch.

Secondly, after an increasing amount of business communication (and cover letters) become written by ChatGPT and other AI tools they will become useless as a way to differentiate between different candidates, and employers will stop asking for them. This will REALLY hurt workers, because cover letters (while annoying to write) are one of the few ways that as an employee you can be more than just your accumulated history on paper.

2377,j6700uw,t3_10mias6,"Oh hey I can field this one as a somewhat expert. I teach vocational rehab and cover letters are required part of the curriculum (which was heavily written by chatgpt). The short answer is yes, it certainly can help write cover letters. However, if the employer even sniffs out the fact that you're using a canned nonspecific cover letter you're better off not having written one at all. My cousin is a recruiter for Facebook and he's of the opinion that cover letters are on their way out anyway precisely because they're often written mechanically like this. My take is that chatgpt can be useful if you take the time to customize your prompt and put some effort into it. For example:

I want you to act as a consultant that specializes in HR and hiring practices.  I will provide you with a writing sample. You will use your rhetorical knowledge and editing skills to rewrite the sample. The rewritten sample should include all the same information, but will be more clear, concise, professional, and tailored to a \[Type of company you're looking to work for.\] Generate a cover letter for a \[describe company by name and give the title and name of the person you are addressing the cover letter to. (Do \*Not\* use ""Hiring Manager"" or ""HR"" as your target audience. Look them up, do some digging) The position is \[XXX\] and involves doing YYYY work. The companies' mission statement is \[Mission statement\] and the position calls for the following skills \[Enter skills\].

That is the level of detail you need in your prompt to get a decent result. The cover letter shouldn't be more than one paragraph long so honestly the prompt is probably more work than the actual cover letter unless you're a terrible writer. However, if you're applying for a lot of positions and you want to rapid fire a bunch of specialized cover letters then I think chatgpt will be of value to you.",t3_10mias6

* 1-2 Short paragraphs explaining why you are interested in becoming part of said company's history and how you look forward demonstrating your earlier qualifications in an on-site interview. All the above needs to fit in 1 page.

2791,j66bqv6,t1_j644mla,"Wompwomp I ended up writing this comment way too long because I'm in the middle of hiring people and was trying to understand what I have been looking for and why. Thanks for helping me cement it I guess :)

I mostly hire undergraduate interns, fresh undergrads and mid-grad program people in software research engineer roles. The absolute *only* thing that sets these candidates apart (aside from the rare upper graduate student), is the cover letter. The resumes are almost all absolutely identical, and I have nothing to go on except interviews and cover letters, and I can't interview everyone. The cover letter is the only place that an applicant can actually get me to notice them, otherwise I basically have to draw your name out of a very very big hat (500 applicants in about 2 weeks last year).

It will obviously be different for your field and who you're applying to but I have a few things to say. I think my general points will be more likely to be useful for entry level positions, roles at smaller organizations where you have to wear a lot of hats, anything where you're acting independently, and just generically positions that aren't well... generic. I.e. this is likely worthless advice for FAANG/megacorps unless it's a special hire. If you think there is a reasonable chance that someone on the team who made the posting will be reviewing your application, it's probably worthwhile to spend a few minutes writing a reasonable cover letter that shows your interest in the job. If you're not that interested in the job, but would take it, then applying without a cover letter is basically zero effort so no real loss.

1. You actually read the job posting. Dropping keywords and rephrasing things from the posting is not sufficient here. The good ones have looked into the organization and have a rough idea of what we do and show that they feel like they can do meaningful work there.
2. You have actual interest in the subject matter and are interested in growing those skills related to it. If this is an entry position and you will be a drain on my resources for many months, at minimum. If you can't show that you can at least find a way for the project to be engaging to you, then you shouldn't be on the project. Uninterested people are going to be crappy to work with. You don't have to feign interest in widgets if it's a widget company though. Just show you'll pay attention to your job.
3. Don't give me your life story or how ""ever since i was a kid i dreamed of doing <x>."" it's bullshit and a waste of time. if it's true, you're 1:100 and I have no way of knowing. See point 1. If your cover letter is just you bullshitting, then don't bother writing it. It's obvious.
4. If your skills don't necessarily immediately connect with the posting, but can be transferred, tell me how/why. This is important to me because the current programming curriculum is garbage for the type of work I do. It also goes back to point 1.
5. Most cover letters I want are around a page. 2 paragraphs just seems like bullshit filler that i could get from your resume. Much more than a page, unless your post is coming off very genuine, seems excessive.
6. Any semblance of personality is good. You can be formal and still write more than a generic form letter.
7. FFS spell things right. Don't copy and paste stuff from the posting. I'd prefer no typos obviously, but a couple and it's fine. The job isn't editing, but not reviewing your work at least once is concerning.
8. No bullet points, please. I have those in your resume
9. I prefer intro and conclusion to be brief because they're the most obvious places for bullshit - they both are saying what I already know - that you want the job.

Bunch of other stuff, but basically, the dominant mentality in this thread is a huge turn-off for my line of work. Also, fwiw, my wife doesn't work in tech, and gets call-backs on her applications at like 30% because she curates the fuck out of her letters and resume.

*Yo, so I've been messing around with this AI thing for writing job application cover letters and I gotta say, it's pretty dope. But let's not act like it's the end-all-be-all solution. There are definitely pros and cons to consider:*

*Pros:*

*Efficiency: Duh, AI can spit out a personalized cover letter in seconds, saving us mere mortals from the tedious task of crafting a unique letter for every job.*

*Tailored content: AI can analyze the job posting and our resume, and generate a letter that perfectly highlights our skills and experience.*

*Reduced bias: The algorithm doesn't give a damn about our race, gender, or any other irrelevant factors, so we don't have to worry about discrimination.*

*Cons:*  
*Lack of personal touch: Let's be real, there's something to be said for the personal touch and authenticity of a hand-written letter. But if you're not willing to put in the effort, then AI is a pretty solid alternative.*  
*Limited creativity: AI can only work with the information it's given, so the letter may lack the unique and creative elements that make a letter truly stand out. But if you're not creative, then AI will be your best friend.*  
*Error-prone: Like any technology, AI can make mistakes. So, if you're not willing to proofread, then AI is not for you.*  


*Overall, AI is pretty cool for writing job application cover letters,but it's not a magic solution. It's all about embracing technology for what it is, a tool, and not a replacement for human creativity or effort.*",t3_10mias6

I care way more about my team fit than the company as a whole, because that's who I work with. And the company and team could be the best fit ever, but if it's severely underpaid nobody's going to want to work there.

We know that Google will continue to serve search results that both monetize you and keep you on platform longer, which means less efficient discovery for the user.

2959,j2wpmfi,t3_1030rqu,"What’s mind blowing is how fast Google usage could collapse if the right alternative product gets released. I now use chatgpt all the time now for simple queries that I would have used Google for in the past. What that’s demonstrated to me is the switching costs for search are close to none. Yeah it’s not perfect and the trained data stops in 2021, but it’s easily effective for around 40% of my searches. And because the user experience is better too, it didn’t take long at all for my brain to default to “I should chatgpt that” as opposed to “I should Google that”. 

In the short term I think consumers will begin to seriously fraction their search behavior across Google and ChatGpt (or whatever AI chatbot is up to par) based on search type. Google will still capture localized search, news, and linking to services, but knowledge seeking searches can be done better elsewhere now.",t3_1030rqu

2962,j2ykl3g,t3_1030rqu,"Honestly, Google search has gotten pretty bad of late. I've seen speculation that this is intentional to keep people on Google rather than only clicking one link. But ultimately, like most things that get measured the things Google uses to rank pages stopped being useful because everyone is optimising for Google Rank regardless of the actual quality of the page. So you've got a website ranked by SEO and people looking for good answers... Needless to say, especially younger people, but people are just sick of being constantly marketed towards, they just want authentic content, and I'm not sure it's possible to get less authentic then SEO.",t3_1030rqu

2965,j2x9ss0,t3_1030rqu,"I see this as a great use of the technology. I’ve already begun using ChatGPT instead of Google for some questions. Depending on how they implement sources and cross references, this would easily make Bing a better Google. I don’t see fake news or misinformation being any bigger of an issue than it is already is. 

In fact, I would propose that it might reduce the spread of misinformation - Think about it, you go on Google now and it serves you a bunch of links which can be anything from professional sources to simple blogs with great SEO. Most folks already tend to use the first few links as their desired answer, which for many things works fine, but not always. And sometimes it’ll serve completely accurate information, but it’ll be worded in such a way that can be misused (I see this with flat earther stuff all the time) 

With a ChatGPT however, Bing would still serve the links as normal, but the ChatGPT response might be able to parse multiple sources and respond with a thorough, easier to understand, answer. 

Of course this depends on how exactly Microsoft would integrate real time web data into ChatGPT, but from my own testing, I’ve gotten good results by feeding ChatGPT the top 10 or so articles on a subject then asking it specific question. So I imagine the teams at OpenAI and Microsoft could make something even more robust.",t3_1030rqu

Beyond the surface though, it's really the ultimate admission that not everything on the internet is factual because ChatGPT has regularly been caught saying incorrect things. I'm really hoping that Microsoft is planning on accounting for this somehow.

On top of that, GPTs cut date for incoming data was sometime in 2021. This means that by the time Bing is using it, all of the data it spits out could be two years old.

What I meant by ChatGPT is not being trained was that you cannot teach your ChatGPT things that it will commit to a long lasting memory right now, but you can do short term things, like the DAN example above.

I don’t know what this reluctance is to acknowledge that the system is incredibly useful today and highly likely to rapidly improve. Google didn’t declare a “code red“ for no reason.

If you are asking more specific things, like in your scenario, you'd rely on reddit less (and ChatGPT as well), going straight for technical references and official sources.
