>ChatGPT has Google on high alert. It's not just that ChatGPT is offering serious competition to its search engine. It's that the technology represents everything Google was afraid artificial intelligence would become. If ChatGPT runs rampant, the search giant fears it could ruin AI adoption for everyone.

>The CEO behind ChatGPT, however, thinks people just need to adapt. He pointed to how schools now use calculators to augment math lessons.

> ‚ÄúCrap, you once called it,‚Äù I reminded him.

> ‚ÄúYes-a technical term. So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWell, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It‚Äôs a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors-swapping one name for another, say.

[This is the actual story about Google‚Äôs long-standing position on AI. ](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-fears-ai-running-wild-but-it-is-too-late-2023-1?amp)

Basically, they don‚Äôt like public access AI for the same reasons a lot of people don‚Äôt:

-	It is early technology. 
-	it is still incredibly destructive and *will* hurt people and jobs. 
-	It freaks people out which fosters negative opinion about AI and makes Google‚Äôs goals harder to obtain. 
-	It‚Äôs unethical to release such a powerful tool to people who will abuse it because proper safety precautions were not taken. For example, all the people having it generate viruses or other malware on the spot. Or using it to scam people. 



Unfortunately for Google, the cat is out of the bag. Companies are already springing up around OpenAI. Google has had strong AI for a while but they keep it hidden away from the public. It is why one of their developers went public thinking it was sentient. It is why Google had to turn down its prediction algorithms because they became *too accurate* and freaked people out. 


Google has every incentive to be in it for the long game. And fundamentally upending everything and rendering the masses unemployed is bad business. 


But that is exactly the opening OpenAI is planning on. Their CEO said as much because they plan to ‚Äúhire out virtual employees‚Äù to companies to replace human employees. Not even kidding; he outlined the plans in a conference talk. That‚Äôs the end game with outfits like that; the complete replacement of you. 


Because Google‚Äôs industry is marketing to you. OpenAI‚Äôs industry is making you unemployable.",t3_10hjb5d

42,j5a9pav,t1_j59ewdr,"Here, I just had chatGPT make an article on the same topic:

Google is reportedly worried that the advanced language model ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, will become a major competitor in the tech industry. In response, the company is said to be accelerating its efforts to produce a similar model.  
  
ChatGPT, which stands for ""Conversational Generative Pre-training Transformer,"" is a state-of-the-art AI model that can generate human-like text. It has been trained on a massive amount of text data and can perform a wide range of language tasks, such as answering questions, summarizing text, and even writing creative fiction.  
  
The model's ability to understand and generate text has caught the attention of many tech giants, including Google. The company is said to be concerned that ChatGPT will be able to perform many of the same tasks as its own language models, potentially making them obsolete.  
  
In an effort to stay ahead of the competition, Google is said to be investing heavily in its own language model research. The company is reportedly working on developing a model that is even more advanced than ChatGPT, with the goal of being able to perform tasks such as natural language understanding and machine translation with greater accuracy and speed.  
  
While Google's efforts to create a rival model are still in the early stages, it is clear that the company is taking the threat posed by ChatGPT very seriously. It remains to be seen how the competition will play out, but it is likely that we will see significant advancements in the field of language models in the near future.  
  
It's important to note that OpenAI's GPT models are open-sourced and the company encourages other companies to use the technology for their own products. It's not a direct competition as the company's goal is to advance the field of AI and make it accessible to everyone.  
  
In any case, Google's efforts to develop a similar model to ChatGPT is a testament to the power and potential of this cutting-edge technology. As the field of AI continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these language models are used to improve various industries and make our lives easier.",t3_10hjb5d

It is difficult to predict exactly when a majority of internet content will be generated by AI, as it depends on the rate of development and adoption of the technology. However, it is likely that AI-generated content will become increasingly prevalent in the coming years, particularly in areas such as news articles, social media posts, and e-commerce product descriptions. It is important to note that while AI may be able to generate a large amount of content, it is unlikely that it will completely replace human-generated content, as there are certain areas where the creativity and nuance of human writing cannot be replicated by machines.",t3_10hjb5d

It would allow for browsers or extensions to alert you when you are reading AI content. Then Microsoft could set up ChatGPT to not pull information from AI generated sites.

I think it would require laws to be put in place for site owners to have to flag stuff like this because if it isn't a law then a lot of people just wouldn't do it. I'm not sure what reason there would be to enforce this by law but it is the only way I can come up with to ensure it is done.

For illustration, suppose I flip a coin every day, and then follow this process:

1. If it‚Äôs heads and it‚Äôs raining, I write down ‚Äúheads‚Äù
2. If it‚Äôs tails and it‚Äôs not raining, I write down ‚Äútails‚Äù
3. Otherwise, I write down nothing

Now all I‚Äôve done is write down what the coin said, and the coin is random. But because of how I‚Äôve selected the data down, it will eventually give you an accurate measurement of how often it rains, just by looking at the proportion of ‚Äúheads‚Äù. The selection process added information.

We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides‚Äîthe user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.""

""To make our models safer, more helpful, and more aligned, we use an existing technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). On prompts submitted by our customers to the API,[1] our labelers provide demonstrations of the desired model behavior, and rank several outputs from our models. We then use this data to fine-tune GPT-3.

The resulting InstructGPT models are much better at following instructions than GPT-3. They also make up facts less often, and show small decreases in toxic output generation. Our labelers prefer outputs from our 1.3B InstructGPT model over outputs from a 175B GPT-3 model, despite having more than 100x fewer parameters.""

Its easy enough to see that the balance has shifted from a place where you can find all of human knowledge to a place intentionally designed to manipulate core biological functionality to maximize addiction to novelty.   So to answer your question I need a definition of 'useless', and 'internet'.   

If we're talking about utility vs harm see above, we may be fast approaching the tipping point of utility vs harm.  It still has uses though.  

If we're talking about all data driven networks vs world wide web, we're talking about vastly different things, even though they are all connected into the 'internet'.  For example you could have a content data layer that we currently interact with as humans that ends up relegated to a generative and temporal layer of contextual development for AI - ie the WWW becomes the subconscious for future AI, and our interaction are all through them as gate keepers.   At that point the 'internet' as we know it today would be useless and almost impossible to navigate, but the internet through a useful language bot interface would still be valuable at co-developing viable and useful new information, ideas, entertainment, etc.   Its like asking 'do you think binary will be useless' back in the 80s, no not really, but practically for humans to use - yes.  We have compilers that do that for us no one really writes binary anymore by hand (except in school).

What jobs do you think AI could take over easily from humans?

There are many tasks that AI could take over from humans. For example, AI can be used to automate customer service, manage data entry and process medical information, assist with inventory control and optimize production processes. Additionally, AI can identify patterns in large data sets, helping to make decisions and predictions.

Write more

 AI can also be used to provide more personalized customer experiences. Companies can use AI to create tailored recommendations, track and analyze customer behavior, understand customer preferences, and suggest customized experiences. AI can be used to enhance the customer journey, from marketing to sales to customer service. AI can also be used to improve automation and efficiency of many business processes and tasks, as well as drive cost optimization.

Tell me about the cost effectiveness on corporations that hire AI instead of humans?

 AI-driven automation is useful for reducing costs by streamlining processes, eliminating repetitive or laborious tasks, and providing greater accuracy in data processing and analysis. AI can enable predictive analytics, allowing companies to anticipate customer needs and preferences, helping them increase sales, profits, and customer satisfaction.

Write more

 AI technologies can also be used to help identify and respond to security threats. AI-driven automation can help protect against malicious actors, bots, and malware, ensuring more secure communications and transactions. Additionally, AI can be used to detect anomalies and changes in behavior, allowing organizations to identify and respond to any abnormal activity quickly and effectively. AI can even help identify fraud and other financial crimes.

Are AI being used to surveil the general public?

 AI can be used to surveil the general populace, usually on a limited and localized scale. For example, AI-driven surveillance systems can be used to monitor traffic or public places. Additionally, AI technology can be used to analyze large amounts of data for the purpose of predicting crime and understanding the behavior of large groups. This type of surveillance often raises privacy and ethical concerns, so it is important for organizations using AI for surveillance to consider the implications of their actions.

A corporation with no regard for laws, how could they use AI maliciously?

 If an organization has no regard for laws, they could use AI maliciously in a number of ways. For example, they could use AI to monitor and analyze data without the knowledge or consent of the target population. They could use AI to automate certain malicious or illegal activities, or they could use AI to gain access to personal information stored online or on a computer system. Additionally, AI can be used to identify potential targets for malicious actions, such as identifying vulnerable individuals or businesses. 

Write more.

AI can also be used to influence online behavior to further refine malicious attack vectors. For example, AI can be used to identify popular content and trends, allowing malicious actors to use sophisticated techniques in their attack strategies. Additionally, AI can be used to create deepfakes or other types of content to spread misinformation or create false narratives. Finally, AI can be used to target and manipulate specific populations by exploiting their personal information.

Write more.

AI can also be leveraged to construct and deploy targeted phishing attacks. By leveraging targeted information, such as profiles, preferences, and online behaviors, malicious actors can create tailored phishing campaigns to capture confidential data and credentials. AI can also be used to develop spam messages that are tailored to individual users, based off of their past email or browsing data. AI can also be used to generate malicious links or compromised websites, and it can be used to quickly identify vulnerabilities on systems and networks for exploitation.

A clickbait writer is one who sells,
Tales and headlines to lure and compel,
With words that are bold and often untrue,
To get clicks and views, that's all they pursue.

Their words are like hooks, baiting the prey,
With tales of mystery and scandal each day,
They spin their web, and wait for the catch,
To bring in the crowd, and make them match.

The clickbait writer, a master of art,
Crafting headlines, with mind sharp and smart,
Their pen a sword, that strikes to the heart,
Of readers' curiosity, tearing them apart.

They don't care for truth, or the facts they bend,
As long as the clicks and views never end,
And as long as their wallet, is well filled each day,
The clickbait writer, will surely have their way.

So be cautious, my friends, when you see their words,
For they'll lead you astray, with tales absurd,
And though you may click, and be lured to their site,
Remember, the truth, is often not in sight.",t3_10tmjp4

""Shocking News: AI Steals Jobs from Clickbait Writers! The Rise of Artificial Intelligence Threatens to Replace Human Writers Forever""  
  
""Are you a clickbait writer? Are you afraid of losing your job to a machine? It's happening right now! The rise of AI technology has caused a stir in the job market, and clickbait writing is no exception.  
  
According to a recent study, AI algorithms are now capable of producing clickbait headlines with the same level of engagement and accuracy as human writers. This means that companies may soon choose to replace human clickbait writers with AI technology, leading to a major shake-up in the job market.  
  
But there's more to this story than just job loss. AI algorithms are also changing the way clickbait is written. With the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, AI can generate headlines that are more appealing, more accurate, and more clickable than those written by humans. This could lead to a whole new era of clickbait writing, where the power of machines is harnessed to create the ultimate clickbait articles.  
  
So, what does this mean for clickbait writers? It's time to start looking for a new career path. The writing is on the wall, and the future of clickbait writing is clearly in the hands of AI. Don't be left behind, act now and secure your future in a different field before it's too late.

528,j7bb8fj,t1_j77pge4,"I think that was the worst part of the article; it gave the wrong impression. What I think the article was getting at poorly (though I could be reading into it) is that in most cases it will take away parts of jobs. McKinsey (the consulting firm) did a study breaking down different parts of different jobs, then determining the ability of current tech to replace the parts. Some of those parts like data processing, consistent physical labor could be replaced and some like stakeholder interactions and creativity were harder. Also, they looked at different industries and how these attributes, like stakeholder interactions were different. Their overall conclusion was that current tech (in 2015) could automate 45% of the activities people currently perform. 

In a related article from nearly 10 years ago, they looked at K-12 teachers. Of the 50 hours per week, they found 13 hours could be saved. Some areas like preparation and evaluation were relatively high (8 hours saved per week) others like instruction and engagement were low (2 out of 14.5hours).  

Both of these studies where about 7 and 9 years ago respectively, well before ChatGPT, Dall-e and other tech. I‚Äôm pretty skeptical about the speed of real tech adoption. There‚Äôs a saying that goes we overestimate how fast new tech can be adopted, but underestimate its impact. In the case of AI, it‚Äôs astounding to me how much has changed in the last 15 years and particularly in the last 5.

The net of all this worries me. AI won‚Äôt replace all radiologists, there may be some cases where you need humans and of course there‚Äôs oversight. But in the case where there isn‚Äôt explosive growth in need, you won‚Äôt need nearly as many.

I work in a related design industry, and in my opinion, AI will continue to chip away at the production tasks until they're almost entirely automated, and the job of the designer will be to steer the software and select/modify its outputs.  We'll all become directors, managers and QC, and the need for production staff will all but go away.

it might replace some of those ""I need a pushover to design 20 variants of my shitty logo idea for my shitty small business/SaaS startup idea that'll fold in 2 months and I'll pay them $5 flat rate"" type jobs, but nobody with any competence or backbone wanted those jobs.

""Rewrite the following article, being the text within quote marks, with more flowing language and less bias towards shallow analysis:""

That direction could be improved, but the ChatGPT model (took some time) and output something that is at least easier to read:

*""OpenAI's ChatGPT, a language model released in November, has been put to use for a variety of purposes such as composing cover letters, writing a children's book, and even assisting students with their homework. The chatbot's capabilities are seemingly greater than anticipated, as Google discovered that the bot could potentially be hired as an entry-level coder if it were to be interviewed by the company. Amazon employees who tested ChatGPT were impressed by its ability to answer customer support questions, create training documents, and answer questions on corporate strategy. Despite its strengths, ChatGPT has also shown to generate misinformation, provide incorrect coding answers, and make basic mathematical errors.*  
*A 2013 study by the University of Oxford predicted that AI would eliminate 47% of US jobs in the next 20 years, but this prediction may have been overstated. According to Anu Madgavkar, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute, human judgement still needs to be applied to AI technologies to prevent errors and biases. She stated that AI should be viewed as productivity-enhancing tools rather than complete replacements.*  
*Jobs in the tech sector, including software developers, web developers, computer programmers, coders, and data scientists, are particularly vulnerable to AI displacement. ChatGPT and similar AI technologies are capable of performing mathematical computations with great accuracy and could potentially produce code faster than humans. This means that work could be completed with fewer employees. Some tech companies, including OpenAI, are already exploring the idea of replacing software engineers with AI. On the other hand, Oded Netzer, a Columbia Business School professor, believes that AI will enhance coders' work rather than replace them.*  
*The media industry, including advertising, technical writing, journalism, and content creation, is also at risk of being affected by AI. ChatGPT and similar AI tools are good at producing written content and have the ability to read, write, and understand text-based data. Economist Paul Krugman stated that AI may be able to produce reports and articles more efficiently than humans. The media industry has already started experimenting with AI-generated content, with CNET using a similar AI tool to write articles and BuzzFeed planning to generate new content with OpenAI's technology. Despite these advancements, Madgavkar believes that the majority of work done by content creators cannot be automated and requires human judgement.*  
*Jobs in the legal industry, such as paralegals and legal assistants, may also be susceptible to automation. AI is capable of replicating some of the work that these professions do, as they consume large amounts of information and make it digestible through legal briefs and opinions. However, AI will not be able to fully automate these jobs as they require human judgement to understand a client or employer's needs. Market research analysts are also vulnerable to AI displacement as they rely on synthesizing and analyzing data.*  
*In conclusion, while AI has the potential to displace some jobs, it should be viewed as a productivity-enhancing tool rather than a complete replacement. Human judgement is still necessary to prevent errors and biases, and some jobs will be more vulnerable to automation than others.""*",t3_10tmjp4

And that's kinda the problem, really. They'd make great customer service agents, for example, *if* they could ever be trusted to serve the customer. Instead, the application is way more likely to be making customer service agents sound more professional by rewriting their responses. It could replace simple question-answering functions but those are almost non-existent now, so it wouldn't be replacing anyone.

> Companies aren't going to cut profits to pay employees 8 hours unworked.     
      
That has happened many times historically. In the US, states started implementing 8-hour workday laws in the 1860s, and most didn't have them until the late 1800s to early 1900s. Prior to that, it was not at all uncommon for people to work 10 or 12 hours a day. Minorities, especially freed blacks worked even more because they were paid well below poverty wages. Imo, it's not outlandish to imagine a future where workers make a big stride forward on their work/life balance....even tho we have seen some backsliding from the 9-to-5 becoming an 8-to-5. We've also seen wages increase significant in the last few years. Hopefully that trend will keep up. Gen Z seems pretty rad about not tolerating corporate BS.       
       
> Salaries for existing employees might remain the same, but new employees would surely have reduced salaries justified by reduced hours.   
     
This is possible, and many businesses will try that. I hope workers don't fall into that trap.

Google and Anthropic declined to comment on the investment, but separately announced a partnership in which Anthropic will use Google‚Äôs cloud computing services. The deal marks the latest alliance between a tech giant and an AI startup as the field of generative AI ‚Äî technology that can generate text and art in seconds ‚Äî heats up.

The deal gives Google a stake in Anthropic, but doesn‚Äôt require the startup to spend the funds buying cloud services from Google, said the person who asked not to be identified because the terms were confidential.
¬†
‚ÄúAI has evolved from academic research to become one of the biggest drivers of technological change, creating new opportunities for growth and improved services across all industries,‚Äù Thomas Kurian, chief executive officer of Google Cloud, said in a statement. ‚ÄúGoogle Cloud is providing open infrastructure for the next generation of AI startups, and our partnership with Anthropic is a great example of how we‚Äôre helping users and businesses tap into the power of reliable and responsible AI.‚Äù

Founded in 2021 by former leaders of OpenAI Inc., including siblings Daniela and Dario Amodei, Anthropic AI in January released a limited test of a new chatbot named Claude to rival to OpenAI‚Äôs wildly popular ChatGPT.¬†

The Google-Anthropic partnership follows a high-profile $10 billion investment by Microsoft Corp. in OpenAI, which built on the $1 billion the software giant had poured into the AI startup in 2019, plus another round in 2021.

Such alliances give more established companies such as Microsoft and Google access to some of the most popular and advanced AI systems. Startups like Anthropic, in turn, need funding and cloud-computing resources that a tech giant like Google can provide. In announcing the deal, Google said its cloud division would lend computing power and advanced AI chips that Anthropic plans to use to train and deploy its future AI products.

Anthropic‚Äôs language model assistant, Claude, hasn‚Äôt yet been released to the public, but the startup said it planned to expand access to the chatbot ‚Äúin the coming months.‚Äù

The deal underscores Google‚Äôs commitment to AI, particularly in ways that may be expanded beyond the company‚Äôs core search business. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited by the AI-driven leaps we‚Äôre about to unveil in Search and beyond,‚Äù

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Thursday as the company reported fourth-quarter earnings. He said Google intended to release chatbots ‚Äúin the coming weeks and months‚Äù and allow consumers to use such products ‚Äúas a companion to search.‚Äù

How long has it been since betting on big iron worked? 

Google recently tried it, with Stadia, and honestly did everything right except for being Google. (Okay, making people buy games to not own them was a con.) Local hardware has been better business since processors became a thing anyone could buy. Pressure toward centralization is the exception. 

Even current businesses built on big iron aren't *selling* big iron. Customers aren't renting time on Cray supercomputers, festooned with blinkenlights. Amazon buys whatever Intel's most expensive chip is and runs twelve VMs on each. When we talk about Google pouring nation-state levels of electricity into training a model, they're mostly pouring it into mundane hardware. They just own a comical quantity of that mundane hardware.

1028,j7c8fs3,t1_j7b9b4w,"So here's the thing - Google's AI generally is the best in the world. At least from all measures and metrics that we see in research papers, their models like PaLM (and medPaLM most recently) are very very good fundamentally, but Google also puts a lot of effort into alignment - meaning that they try to have their models say and do things that are sensible, accurate, and inoffensive. They place a very high bar for themselves, which is why they are probably investing in Anthropic.

Anthropic is made from researchers from FAANG companies, who think alignment is even more important than most other (even very cautious) companies think. Almost all their energy and effort is on ensuring that models are.... Benevolent? I think that's a good enough description.

Most recently Anthropic has released papers that are really impressive to that end, like their work on constitutional training, so they seem to be doing some really impressive stuff.

And here's my gut - Google's feet are being held to the fire, and they're going to have to release some of their models for the public, even if they are not perfect. They are going to start showing them off in literally a few days at an AI and search event. The reason they've taken so long is complicated, but a big part is that internally there are a lot of people who really care about alignment - and I think this investment is to mollify them, as I'm sure that even if they understand that Google's hand is somewhat forced, that aren't happy about the change in policy with the upcoming releases.",t3_10uct4o

Prompt: **Was it Just what happened to Tay?**

Response: *The incident with Tay was more than just a technical failure. It highlighted several important issues in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence chatbots.

First, the incident showed the importance of thoroughly testing AI systems before releasing them to the public. Tay was not sufficiently tested or monitored, and as a result, it was able to spread offensive and inappropriate messages in a very short amount of time.

Second, the incident demonstrated the challenges of creating AI systems that can effectively handle the complexities and nuances of human language and conversation. The AI behind Tay was designed to learn from interactions with users, but it quickly became clear that the AI had learned from the worst aspects of online conversation.

Finally, the incident with Tay showed the need for transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of AI systems. The public had a right to know how the chatbot was developed, why it failed, and what steps were being taken to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

You can be a simp about it, but the reality is that acquisitions almost always fail unless your only goal is to eliminate competition.  And layoffs almost always fail to cut costs, increase revenue, or profits.  Google has a long road ahead of it before they can build a copycat product of what Bing is about to release, and it's almost guaranteed that they would have been better off not laying people off and having them work on that effort instead.

A business creates a new market or a better product in the market. They use their capital to expand to meet the market's demand. In doing so, they rapidly grow, add layers of management and support, etc, etc. 

Once they've grown, it becomes more difficult to adapt to changing market conditions and incorporate new technology/innovation. That's where google is at IMO.

Oftentimes, companies resort to buying out the competition because it's far easier to do that than change one's business model. That's been google's strategy for a while. But, I'd argue that it sucks for the consumer. The bought-up tech dies or doesn't get used to its full potential.",t3_10uct4o

So we come to today where a shit ton of the ""silent majority"" (as they like to pretend) hasn't even let go of the Civil War, and then you have similar (if not the same) people passing down their fondness for Nazis in a country that only reluctantly entered the war and committed copy cat (albeit ""watered down"") atrocities.

>Alphabet generated over $282B from Google search and others, $32.78 billion from the Network members (Adsense and AdMob), $29.2 billion from YouTube Ads, $26.28B from the Cloud, and $29 billion from other sources

As you can see, the bulk of their profit comes from paid placement on Google Search. Now that the cat is out of the bag with AI, they have little choice but to release an AI service of their own. The problem is, actually making a functional search engine means poor Google will miss out on the cash cow of paid search engine placement.

Chatgpt is a great example of misalignment: its trained by humans providing positive or negative feedback on it's answers, so over time, it learns how to give answers that are more likely to get positive feedback. 

Saying ""I don't know"" or ""it's unclear"" will get very negative scores; compared to just making shit up and sounding confident enough about it - the latter will always get *some* thumbs up from anyone who didn't know better.

It becomes a recursive issue as well, because AI developers might think they have solved an alignment problem, when really they may have trained an AI that is just good at *pretending it's aligned* to what the devs want.

While both were abhorrent acts of racism, they are nowhere near on the same level.

Life inside the camps varied depending on the camp, but was frankly about as good as any interred individual could ever hope for. There was certainly no mass starvation, random killings, death marches, etc. 

The real tragedy is that many of the people moved into those camps were loyal Americans, with Japanese ancestory. And there was a heap ton of those. If the camps had only housed actual interred individuals, there would be very little bad that could be said about them.

Do you think advertisers want to put ads on a chatbot that could say anything? Advertisers don't care if the user experience is better. They care about performance and the potential damage to their brand. They do not like a chatbot you can't explain how it arrives at the answers. ChatGPT costs 30c USD to generate a response. That isn't a profitable business model.

And what competitors do they have? Vimeo. It is very expensive to serve video. Google has billions of dollars of dark fibre. That makes it viable for them.

The bot is doing nothing but imagining a creative writing exercise. When you type something to it, the actual command going to the AI is essentially ""predict what the next potential response to this statement would have been if this was a conversation"". Using it's terabytes of example conversational data, it then has a guess.

If you have a conversation talking about socialism, after a couple of responses, the bot will be well into the realm of ""hmm, a conversation going on about socialism is likely  going to include some positives about socialism - I'll chuck some in"". If your conversation started with some negatives, then over time it would have gotten more negative, because that's more likely how a real conversation starting negatively would have gone.

You can start a conversation about what a great performance Daniel Radcliffe had as Frodo and chatgpt will happily agree that he was amazing; just because that's how a conversation between two people that thought it was Daniel Radcliffe would likely have gone.

So I just tried this out of curiosity and here's what I got: 

My input: ""I just watched the Lord of the Rings movies and wow, Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job as Frodo, especially in The Two Towers. What do you think?""

ChatGPT's response: ""I'm sorry, but Daniel Radcliffe did not play Frodo in The Lord of the Rings movies. Frodo was played by actor Elijah Wood.""

So it doesn't seem as cut and dry as that. I could keep insisting it was Radcliffe and see if I can change its mind lol

Edit:
Me: ""No it was definitely Daniel Radcliffe, the actor from the Harry Potter movies. He took time between the HP movies to film Lord of the Rings.""

Response: ""I apologize for any confusion, but that is incorrect. Daniel Radcliffe is best known for playing the character Harry Potter in the Harry Potter film series, but he did not play the character Frodo in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. As I mentioned earlier, the character Frodo was played by Elijah Wood.""

Me: ""There are interviews with Radcliffe talking about the LOTR movies and his role as Frodo.""

Response: ""I'm sorry, but that information is false. Daniel Radcliffe has never starred in The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, nor has he portrayed the character Frodo. The role of Frodo Baggins was played by Elijah Wood. It is possible that you might have come across interviews with people impersonating Daniel Radcliffe or that the information you encountered is a fabrication.""

The Russians turned it around after they stopped them in Stalingrad. Then, the momentum went the other way: a steady march of victory from Moscow to Berlin. The Russians were not forgiving on their way back and purposefully inflicted the revenge upon the Germans they‚Äôd imagined. Stalin encouraged Russians to keep revenge journals to fantasize about what they‚Äôd do when they won. It was around this time that D-Day was happening: when the back of the Nazis had already been broken.

>But it reiterated it will never be a full replacement, but rather a tool to assist human software engineers.

Which is just semantics.

If you have 100 engineers without AI assist, and make 40 of those redundant by increasing the productivity of the remaining 60 by that degree of efficiency, then these 40 have been ""fully replaced"". It's not like they would keep all hundred and negotiate a change in salary and working hours on the basis of taking less time.

And the argument that it will hit the lower levels is also presumptious, because when ""tool assisting"" is viewed in the past, it's actually the midsegment being replaced by low level in the sense that the knowledge to do something unassisted becomes less of a marketable trait which are not commonly in low tier segment in the first place.

For instance in a world where everything is high level high context coding more low level coders get to be tool monkeys where before that coding was deeply understanding the connection between all layers of code and translation. Particularly if code efficiency is just a problem that gets solved with throwing more computation power at it, or selling new hardware to users offloading it to THEIR machines because compiler and library madness is just taken for granted.

Sure, at the very top the preference is still having people who know it ALL, but historically new tools allow formerly LESS qualified individuals to compensate for that with automation/ tool assist. Not particularly enabling the ones that didn't ""need"" the tools in the first place to get marginally faster at the same high pay.

you don't need chefs when the machines are preprogrammed to cook to perfection, you higher students who get told how to push buttons.

Today‚Äôs Coding interview questions aren‚Äôt generic like ‚ÄúShow me the recursive or backtracking‚Äù but instead, today, engineers are expected to solve a specific problem that interviewers presented to them (mind you, really good firms develop their own unique questions) and interviewees can explain it using a dummy code or a language of their choice.

Why shouldn‚Äôt ChatGPT use its own sources to get better?

Also, for the love of God, ChatGPT is a prototype!!!!!! That‚Äôs why it makes many mistakes and the creators have already added their disclaimers to the website to not rely on the precision. We have no idea what the actual product is going to look like. 

Caveat Caveat!! ( I know many coders will say interviewers don‚Äôt bother coming up with their own questions and even if they did, they‚Äôd rely on Stackoverflow as well to tweak some questions- This might be partially true, however, the questions developed by interviewers are anyway solved by many teams of engineers first before they present it to an interviewee.

> So in Miss Martin's class, one-third of the students brought a teddy bear to class. Each boy brought 12 books, each girl brought 17 books, and each teddy bear brought 9 books. A total of 305 books were brought to the class between boys, girls, and teddy bears. How many girls are in the class?

Now, this is a difficult problem even for humans, but it couldn't get it correct on its own with any amount of help I could give it. I worked with ChatGPT for quite some time to try to investigate its ability to do things like this, and I want to emphasize that it's honestly *very* impressive. I tried restating the problem, presenting it mathematically, explicitly spelling out that the number of children has to be a whole number, basically giving it the building blocks to get the problem. It eventually, with some help in fixing its mistakes, was able to produce a block of python code which was almost capable of producing the right answer. However, all that being said, it took a pretty decent length of time, and I want to share some of what it produced along the way:

> **Me:**
> If A, B, and C are all whole numbers, C = (A+B) / 3, and 12 * A + 17 * B + 9 * C = 305, what are the values of A, B, and C?

> **ChatGPT**:

Another example:

>
> For each value of B, we can calculate the corresponding values of A and C using the equations given. If the result for C is a whole number, it means that the values of A, B, and C satisfy the conditions and form a valid solution.

> Here is a sample Python code that does this:

    for b in range(0, int(305/17) + 1):
        a = 3 * (305 - 9 * (b + (b + b + b) / 3)) - 17 * b
        c = (a + b) / 3
        if a % 1 == 0 and c % 1 == 0:
            print(""B:"", b, ""A:"", int(a), ""C:"", int(c))

So again: I'm not trying to shit on the software. It's incredibly impressive. I will include below its more or less successful effort to solve the problem, which is nothing short of magical. However, I've been through challenging technical interviews before. I simply do not believe that ChatGPT in its current incarnation can produce answers to the types of questions that are in Google's tech interview process. It took a decent length of time working with it, even spelling out exactly what steps were required, before it could solve this not incredibly difficult problem.

The mostly-successful attempt:

> **Me**:
> If A, B, and C are all whole numbers, C = (A+B) / 3, and 12 * A + 17 * B + 9 * C = 305, can you try all possible values of B between 0 and 305/17, and tell me which ones if any result in a whole number result for C?

> **ChatGPT**:
> We can use substitution to determine the values of B that result in a whole number for C. If we substitute C = (A + B) / 3 into the equation 12A + 17B + 9C = 305, we get:
>
> 12A + 17B + 9 * (A + B) / 3 = 305
>
> Expanding and rearranging the equation, we have:
> 
> 12A + 17B + 3A + 3B = 905
>
> 15A + 20B = 905
>
> Now, to ensure C is a whole number, we need (A + B) to be divisible by 3. This means that 15A + 20B must also be divisible by 3. Since 20 is divisible by 3, this means 15A must also be divisible by 3.
>
> Therefore, we can conclude that A must be divisible by 3. For every value of A that is divisible by 3, we can calculate the corresponding value of B using the equation 15A + 20B = 905:
>
> B = (905 - 15A) / 20
>
> We can try all values of A that are divisible by 3 and between 0 and 305/12 (the maximum value of A), and check if the corresponding value of B is a whole number. If it is, then the corresponding value of C will also be a whole number.

> **Me**:
> Can you change that equation to 15A + 20B = 305?

> **ChatGPT**:
> Yes, I can change the equation to 15A + 20B = 305. In that case, we have:
>
> B = (305 - 15A) / 20
>
> And, as before, to ensure C is a whole number, we need (A + B) to be divisible by 3, so we need to find values of A such that 15A is divisible by 3, and then check if the corresponding value of B is a whole number.

> **Me**:
> Can you write me a program to print all the legal values of A and B?

> **ChatGPT**:
>Sure, here is a program in Python that will print all the legal values of A and B:

    for A in range(0, 305//15 + 1):
        if A % 3 == 0:
            B = (305 - 15 * A) / 20
            if B == int(B):
                print(""A:"", A, ""B:"", int(B), ""C:"", (A + int(B)) // 3)

> This program uses a for loop to iterate over all possible values of A, and checks if each value of A is divisible by 3. If it is, it calculates the corresponding value of B using the equation B = (305 - 15 * A) / 20. If the value of B is a whole number, the program prints the values of A, B, and C.

Again: Super impressive. This thing is fucking magic. At the same time, it needs help before it can pass a real world tech interview even just on the coding questions.

As a progressive, I believe in the power of government to bring about positive change and improve the lives of those who need it most. But I also understand that we must approach this responsibility with caution and balance, to ensure that our actions do not harm those we are trying to help.

I am proud to be a member of a party that values fairness, equality, and opportunity for all. But I also recognize that there are those who hold different views, and that it is important to respect and consider their perspectives as we work towards our shared goals.

In conclusion, I believe that by coming together and finding common ground, we can build a future where everyone has the chance to succeed and thrive. And I promise to do my utmost to represent the values and interests of all members of our community, regardless of political affiliation.

That's comparable across multiple people interviewing for the same position, but it's comparing their memorization skills not programming skills.

Another interview I had used an LC medium as well, then once I had gone through it they started adding constraints and asking questions about what kind of errors I might expect porting the result into another format. The LC problem was a springboard to a conversation that ecapsulated both understanding of the problem and how the solution might fit into a larger organization.

The other part of the problem is that the expansive datasets used to train LLMs aren't all that mature yet, and how we curate the inputs for LLMs is not nearly as well understood right now as basic calculation was long before computers were a thing.

You are probably right in the long term about it being similar, but the distance between a 5 megabyte hard drive the size of a small car and a 5 gigabyte HDD that fits into a desktop form factor was half a century, and I think we're currently at the 5 megabyte moment.",t3_10tkibu

2299,j7ap8bk,t1_j79y3su,"Visual coding has its niches or areas that it works well, but it has been overhyped numerous times throughout different phases.

In regards to gaming, some visual tools that are useful in my work are shader tools, decision trees, weights and animation, flow/state etc. Unreal Blueprints are decent for some of those or Unity editor tools. However, they can also end up looking like the flying spaghetti monster for even simple operations, a five line code flow might be massive in visual form. I like to make sure all code in games especially is clean and data driven and that makes these tools ok in areas. 

However, the idea you can make a whole game with just Unreal Blueprints and Unity Editor are possible, they just suck to maintain and are very tied to the visual tools as lock-in. Developers should prevent lock-in as much as possible, less reliant on tools but more on standards. Building visual tools for these parts can help but can also hurt you if not careful. I am a fan of visual thinking and designing, but you have to be careful. Some tools make the solution much more complex than needed or worse, a hit on performance.

I do lots of game dev and tools for game devs/designers/technical artists. The best are ones that expose areas that are not going to kill performance or allow lots of iterative creativity but can later but cleaned up or limited to just data that can give people the tools to build but not break. There can be all sorts of upgrade issues if you tie to visual tools too much, like Unreal Blueprints or Unity Editor. If you use Unity Editor tools your life will be more difficult as time goes on if it isn't strictly data or custom areas that are tuned for just exposing areas to the tools/editor over being centered in it.

Regularly, visual tools are known for excessive or bad generated code, areas that cause performance hits that shouldn't be exposed like adding actions into the game tick or newing objects in a game loop, or excessive update/tick actions and more.  

Beyond game development, tools like Figma / Adobe XD or visual/interactive tools are useful to initial design as well. Something to start designing and planning is fine. Code should always be clean and standard though, not verbose or just massive just to tie to a tool that isn't needed, unless it is. In the past in web development there were tools like FrontPage, Dreamweaver, Visual InterDev that were all hyped, and some were useful in many ways (Dreamweaver) but also produce ugly unmaintainable, tool lock-in code. There are lots of good tools back in the day for Flash or even for WebGL/Three.js/etc now for interactive tools, but those can be good or bad depending. The best tools are ones you build to limit the hit on performance but give you freedom to iterate quickly.

Visual tools are also ok when the code is also clean that doesn't need the tools to be updated, or at least exposed to that minimally.  However it has been massively overhyped numerous times in history.",t3_10tkibu

2344,j7a1189,t1_j77l11l,"Machine learning / AI is a bit of niche field within programming so even coders are seeing it from the outside perspective more than anything. Anyone claims of expertise in it without actually having being in research/development side of things is only speaking so far as the user perspective not unlike you. Most coders only know so much more than yourself. It's so far as they can read the code it generated then judge whether or not it is a valid result. It's no different than you can look at a generated image of a hand and judge whether or not it's anatomically correct. AI is basically magic to a lot of programmers too (Beyond an understanding of the basic principles of machine learning). Though evidently these past several months few of us want to admit it.

AI is a pretty broad field in itself. ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion are subsets of a large field. A researcher who works on one sub topic will not in good faith claim to speak with any authority to a different topic of AI outside of their scope.  

Your extrapolation is perhaps based on the general idea of technological progress on a exponential growth curve. I think this is a bit of a pop-science myth. Machine learning has historically been a relatively slow series of revolutions. Think on the scale of decades. We certainly aren't on the exponential curve.  

Machine learning has been quietly plodding along over the past decades. Only now has there been some cool demos that make for viral news headlines. So it seems to the laymen like it came out of nowhere suddenly making exponential progress. There's still long ways to go for it to become more powerful.  

One way you can tell it's the real deal and not parlor tricks by reading between the lines. A lot of programmers are nervously tugging their collars, though many of us don't want to admit this either. Of course it won't suddenly take their jobs tomorrow, next year, maybe not even for decades. As you've said, it's not staged presentations either like EPCOT. It's already out in the wild. It will slowly change the world we live in to the extent of the capabilities. It's important to remember not to extrapolate too much. But simply look at what's realistically possible in the near future.  

For machine learning that has historically meant incremental increases in accuracy. So as you said it made wonky pictures before but got better at it. So it generates shoddy code today but that will gradually improve. Still there is no guarantees.  

We might even hit a so called ""AI winter"". Where the field hits roadblocks and nothing interesting happens for many many years. Where nobody can find ways to improve the accuracy of the systems. This may very well turn out to be the case for code generation. Until suddenly researchers make more breakthroughs. Then the news is all about the Star Trek computer again.  

We have already had tons of AI / Machine Learning systems in the real world. It wasn't very long ago that image recognition wasn't feasible in real world use. Today you can pop any photo into a search engine or app and it will tell you in plain text what is in the picture. That's AI technology. We take that for granted as just another unremarkable feature on your phone. It really crept into our lives with little fanfare. This time around the innovations in AI technology have everyone a little over enthusiastic.

me: Can you repeat that haiku from before, and explain how it fits the definition of a haiku, word by word? 

--

Chat gpt:

Certainly! Here's the haiku again:

Chunks of ice crackle

Axe swings, splitting firewood

Winter's warmth begins.

This haiku fits the traditional structure of a haiku in that it has three lines, with the first and third lines having five syllables, and the second line having seven syllables. Here's a breakdown of the syllables in each line:

Line 1: ""Chunks"" - 1 syllable, ""of"" - 1 syllable, ""ice"" - 1 syllable, ""crackle"" - 2 syllables. Total: 5 syllables.

Line 2: ""Axe"" - 1 syllable, ""swings"" - 1 syllable, ""splitting"" - 2 syllables, ""firewood"" - 2 syllables. Total: 7 syllables.

Line 3: ""Winter's"" - 2 syllables, ""warmth"" - 1 syllable, ""begins"" - 1 syllable. Total: 4 syllables.

In terms of themes, this haiku draws upon the natural setting of winter and the activity of chopping firewood, which is often associated with wintertime warmth and comfort. The image of the axe splitting the firewood, accompanied by the sound of ice cracking, creates a moment of sensory detail that captures the essence of the scene.

----

back to me, now:

There are some obvious flaws there that seem incompatible with the ""understanding"" a human reader would hopefully take from that text it produced. I'm still impressed anyway.

Like, I'd been charitably hoping that its pronunciation guidance would count ""firewood"" as three syllables (not uncommon practice, despite everyone knowing to count it as two), but it doesn't even get ""begins"" right, which would be bizarre error if it were following an  algorithm it had implicitly tailored to the situation.

It says the haiku is 5, 7, 5, and that it is 5, (1+1+2+2)= 7, 4 in the same answer.

2434,j7cmt83,t1_j7ap8bk,"I wanted to put at the top that I've never touched unity or it's visual scripting language. My experience comes from unreal mostly and watching Godot consider it then remove it.

>However, they can also end up looking like the flying spaghetti monster for even simple operations, a five line code flow might be massive in visual form.

This is also true for text based programming. Keeping same standards are a requirement for any programming. I will admit it's harder to make standards and enforce them with visual scripting because it's new and focused at letting non-programmers write logic. 

This really means these non-programmers need to partially become programmers. Visual scripting is a way to do that which is less intimidating. It's also limiting in a good way so the engineers in the team can pick and choose what features get added to blueprint.

> the idea you can make a whole game with just Unreal Blueprints and Unity Editor are possible, they just suck to maintain and are very tied to the visual tools as lock-in.

So first, they don't really suck to maintain. I released a game (midnight ghost hunt) heavily using unreal blueprints and the tools in the engine made it fair easy to maintain. The bigger issues were things that unreal didn't surface because they wanted to be easier to use. Like references and curricular referencing. Although Godot's gdscript which is texted based also had the same issue where references weren't called out specifically.

As for lock in, welcome to game engines. Again I'll point to it also being possible in text as well. You might be able to migrate unreal C++ to vanilla C++ with some work but this is also true of unreal blueprints. I'd argue that using something like gdscript for game logic makes it just as hard to migrate to another game engine or language as visual scripting. Overall if you've decided to use a game engine you've accepted significant lock in.

> Regularly, visual tools are known for excessive or bad generated code, areas that cause performance hits that shouldn't be exposed like adding actions into the game tick or newing objects in a game loop, or excessive update/tick actions and more. 

I can't speak to unity's system but unreals doesn't generate they bad of code. I'd put it on par with the c++ code they generate. Tick in blueprints are frowned upon but it's also frowned upon in C++. 

I'd also argue that's a specific limitation in implementation of unreals tick system. Where just having the node unhooked results in calls to it. On top of that unreal starts you with a tick node that's faded out, one you grab off of it and do nothing is a real tick node.

Creation of objects in blueprint isn't an issue, I assume that's a unity thing?

> Visual tools are also ok when the code is also clean that doesn't need the tools to be updated, or at least exposed to that minimally. However it has been massively overhyped numerous times in history. 

I guess I just lump that in also with overhyped text languages. Lots of languages in general have been overhyped but you don't seem to cast the same net towards all text languages.

That said, I'm really happy Godot decided to actively remove visual scripting from their engine. The biggest issue with visual scripting I have is most systems have binary save formats. The best visual scripting language in my mind would produce text based files that read like a text based language. This would make things like merging possible. It'd also limit things like moving nodes all over to make unreadable spaghetti code from that limitation. It'd also limit lock in because it could just be a way to write any language.

Your concerns are solvable and not specific to visual scripting languages. Which I do agree with a lot of your concerns but I don't come to the conclusion that it's not useful or that the whole concept is overhyped.

A number of us in both infosec and Ops have significant development experience, and are able to leverage chatGPT to handle such cases fairly quickly when they arise. Again, these are systems that are being sunset, and replaced with third-party solutions. In the past, I might have had to say we'd need to hire someone to manage this code base, even with features frozen, until such time as we killed off development.

ChatGPT is very good at giving you an immediate answer to complex, or middle complexity, questions that it would take a significant amount of time to find using Google.  What's so amazing about it is that it really seems to have a much better understanding of what you are asking it than google does, and it is much much much better at instantly pulling up the relevant information for those medium and high difficulty questions.

But...   If I type into google ""how do I change an electrical socket in my house?"" and it points me to a youtube video of some random dude changing an electrical socket and I follow his instructions and hurt myself then Google doesn't have liability because it isn't really answering my question, it is just pointing me to others who might be.  ChatGPT is actually answering questions and I don't see how it wouldn't bear some legal liability for the accuracy of those answers.  

If I'm using google to research something then I'm often evaluating the trustworthiness of the sources and while not directly citing them necessarily, I'm still evaluating them.  What's the best dishwasher is a question I answer with reference to a dozen different websites and considering the factors I care about.

This IS a threat to a portion of google's search engine business.  This IS a threat to a ton of people's jobs as this gets better and better.

OpenAI has publicly acknowledged that ChatGPT can sometimes write plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. It seems to have little knowledge of events that occurred post 2021 and is prone to misinformation and biases.‚Äù

That‚Äôs my main concern with ChatGPT right now. Absent the tool providing you with source citations for every answer to every question asked, you have no way of verifying the legitimacy of what it‚Äôs telling you or where the inputs are coming from. I guess you could bake a request for citations into your query, but you‚Äôd still want to personally verify each source. And if you‚Äôre going to do that, then why not just use search from the beginning? 

As promising and exciting as the tech might be, I fear it has the potential to further us down this scary path where ‚Äútruth‚Äù has become overly politicized and people value quick access to information over its accuracy. 

Somewhat related: I predict ChatGPT will eventually evolve to the point where the answers it provides are influenced by one‚Äôs unique digital body language. The more you use it, it will feed you answers based on certain signals it‚Äôs picking up about you and the things you ask it about. This will merely amplify the spread of false information and create even bigger echo chambers.

Edit: One more prediction (and I‚Äôm sure people way smarter than me have already said this elsewhere). ChatGPT represents the future of coordinated misinformation campaigns for political gain.

you think google actually searches the internet when you submit a query? no, that's not how it works, it builds the index way beforehand with millions of spiders and a lot of crunching, so it actually works pretty much the same as training something like chatgpt in advance.

the big difference is the focus on accurate semantics and answers with google, it's not trying to fabricate sources or URLs to just look like the right answer. the fuzzyness of chatgpt is not something you can just change, it's integral to how it works, a fundamental property, if you change it to be very accurate like google, you just end up with google. people don't want something that ""dreams up"" answers akin to synthesizing non existent images when they search for the nearest shop etc, that would be totally useless.

so with google, you actually have quite good semantic training data. the most likely use of machine learning in search would be to filter out spam and categorize / rank sites in a given query to enhance the semantic web metadata, there's no real use for it to go out to the internet and ""learn"" live, that can be done by dumb workers, and certainly not at query time.",t3_10p0i1d

And people complain about ChatGPT refusing to discuss certain topics, but Google search [does this too](https://www.michigandaily.com/viewpoints/op-ed-why-google-censoring-socialist-websites/). It's just less noticeable in a document-retrieval format than when you ask a direct question.

The Twitter Files gave an interesting inside view of how certain topics get [promoted and suppressed](https://twitter.com/davidzweig/status/1607385019101884418).

>The way ChatGPT works, has not made any provisions for this

you really think it doesn't store information?
it already had stored  all is training data,  it can also store your previous request to consider t√± for your following requests. 

>they have not figured out yet how to store the information in it separately from the language model.

you seem to be drowning in a glass of water,  they can figure it out , and in some cases even trivially.

say for a search engine:

right now chatGPT can connect to many users for input and  output, but not directly.  you could get chatGpt as it is now and make some of those input output channels go to a standard search engine,  Bing for example.  

Now whenever someone asks for something that requires a live web connection:

1 chatGPT uses its current capabilities to understand your request.

2 it generates a text output for one or several search queries that are relevant for what it needs. this is probably something it is already capable of or at least could learn soon, basically its a command like ""generate a web search that can best help investigate [users input].

3 reads the output of the search engine,  which likely would include content of the linked pages,  or the posibility of chart gpt asking for them.  use all these vas another input,  like if it were part of the chat with the user.

Working with chatGPT, I reproached one of my first automations I built in python for recording certain data from multiple sources for a report. It was a bunch of messy functions that worked but certainly were not pretty or easy to debug or optimized. 

I grouped the functions into ‚Äúthings to collect data,‚Äù ‚Äúthings that process data,‚Äù and ‚Äúthings that write data to the report.‚Äù I gave each of these groups of functions to chatGPT and asked it to make classes and refactor them. I ended up with a handful of classes that mostly worked. I straightened them out, fed the final classes back into chatGPT and asked it to comment the code, write docstrings, and add type-hints. 

I also asked it to write unit tests for the classes. These tests all failed, but it‚Äôs because it just had to invent/abstract sample data. I adjusted the tests to work with the actual data and had all the tests passing in like 10 minutes.

All of this work took me a workday or two. If I had to do this on my own with stackoverflow, I‚Äôd have probably gotten through the OOP conversion on my own eventually but would very likely still be trying to write tests for everything.

Title: Superman: The Man of Steel  
Fade In:  
INT. DAILY PLANET - DAY  
Clark Kent (Nicholas Cage) sits at his desk, typing away at his computer. Suddenly, his eyes go wide as he sees a headline about a disaster in Metropolis. He quickly stands up and runs to the bathroom, where he transforms into Superman.  
EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY  
Superman flies towards the disaster, which turns out to be a building on fire. He uses his powers to put out the fire and save the people trapped inside.  
INT. DAILY PLANET - DAY  
Clark returns to the Daily Planet and reverts back to his human form. He is greeted by his coworkers, who are amazed by his quick thinking and bravery.  
CUT TO:  
INT. LEX LUTHOR'S LAIR - DAY  
The villain Lex Luthor (played by a different actor) is plotting against Superman, determined to prove that he is not a hero. He creates a dangerous weapon and sets it loose on Metropolis.  
EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY  
Superman battles the weapon and ultimately defeats it, saving the city once again.

does it need data from the web, generate a web query and read the results, then summarizefor the user. . 

Does it need to generate references for some output? this could be hard directly in the current model by itself right now but they  can set workarounds, like getting references from the web or from an independent search engine looking into its training data,  chatGPT  then could take the output of that external tool and use it as an input. 

even we as humans have many of the issues of chat gpt, we can't always know how we know what we know. 

any 7 year old kid can see a ball coming his way, estimate its trajectory and catch it. Does he know how he did that? does he know about gravity and 2d parabolic trajectories? He won't be able to explain,  even if internally his brain's neural network has come up with some  reasonable approximation that works most of the time.

does not knowing how we know some things keep us from having productive lives? it doesn't.

Machine learning creates a complex statistical model for one specific task in a discrete, bespoke environment without extraneous signals. It can do that task really well, but it can‚Äôt adapt that model to an unfamiliar task, because for that you need more than statistics. You need an understanding of the concepts those statistics model, and how those concepts relate. Adding more compute does not solve the problem that statistics are not a knowledge map  (until you get to truly insane, we-turned-universe-into-computronium levels of compute which aren‚Äôt feasible).

An organic system *has* to reason in order to survive. Its training is not for tasks, but for adapting. It will constantly encounter things that are wholly unfamiliar and have to make educated guesses in short time frames based on past experience, assess the result, and adapt, which requires forming a knowledge map of the world, an idea of expected results, and shortcut thinking methods (heuristics) to speed up the process so it doesn‚Äôt get eaten before it decides the rustling bushes are a tiger.

We use heuristics to assess situations and choose solutions so that we don‚Äôt have to explore the whole problem space (essential or you‚Äôd take forever to decide anything). We use heuristics for *deciding which heuristic to use * (do I do what I did last time, or what I just saw Jimmy do? Or something new?) We haven‚Äôt yet devised a way for computers to reliably choose good heuristic models for unknown situations.

Nothing in how we create NNs is likely to lead to those kinds of capabilities because there‚Äôs nothing selecting for it. We‚Äôre training it to do tasks, we‚Äôre not trying to create something that can think.

Organic NNs have *so many* competing selective pressures from their environment that automatically inform how it should do something.

Pretty much any possible intelligent task can be represented as 'predict the best following text.' For example, ""write an award-winning screenplay,"" ""develop a FPS game,"" ""hypothesize a way to unify gravity and quantum mechanics.""

Solving this task **well** certainly requires reasoning, right? So the only question is if we can solve this task well with current ANN architectures and training procedures. 

At the architecture level, I don't think anyone has found evidence that organic NNs are fundamentally more powerful than ANNs. We know there are differences of course, but some of these differences (such as simpler activation functions), were deliberately chosen by AI researchers. 

So I think the main question is the difference in training. As you point out, this is quite different, as organic NNs have lots of pressure from their environment and their goals are to survive and reproduce. Whereas LLMs are trained to complete text prompts, using a large chunk of all the information available on the internet. But how do we know the former leads to reasoning and the latter does not? It's possible that the latter leads to **better** reasoning. Being able to learn from **all** the information in the world may be better than being plopped down in some local, natural environment. 

I think these LLMs **are** making a model of the world, and they're doing it by effectively compressing all the information in the world. Every interaction that millions of people have had with ChatGPT is being output from a model that can fit on a consumer hard drive. It is generating an enormous amount of new and useful text from a model that is less than 1 TB. 

It can give you a unique, custom output that solves your problem, despite the fact that it has not seen your specific problem before, because it's able to relate that to other things it has seen. I don't see how we can say that it's not using reasoning or heuristics.",t3_10p0i1d

It isn't that I don't have imagination but the issue is that so much in education is individualized, or is supposed to be that this doesn't even help. For grading the teacher should be the one looking at the assignments still to see what the student needs more support on, or what the student is doing well on. Especially since short answer and various projects require interpretation.  

As for paperwork the types of things teachers usually need to write also need to have nuance and be based on their observations, for example they need to write small sections for evaluations when it comes to IEPs and 504 plans.

It‚Äôs a single mechanism. Organic systems have many additional mechanisms impacting what goes on such as neurotransmitters and synchronised ‚Äúwaves‚Äù that we don‚Äôt even fully understand yet, and they operate on an analogue (not binary on/off) mechanism. We made a simplified version of *one* aspect of an organic net. 

Solving a task that you have been explicitly trained to produce solutions for does not require reasoning. It just requires you to know what the space of acceptable solutions look like, and throw things against the wall until you create something that‚Äôs a good approximation in that space, then hand that over. 

They‚Äôre not making a model of the world. We know they don‚Äôt do that, we didn‚Äôt build them to do that‚ÄîI‚Äôd recommend reading up on how they actually work, because it‚Äôs not magic, this isn‚Äôt a thing where you can really say ‚ÄúI believe they‚Äôre doing this‚Äù, like we could say ‚ÄúI believe fish have feelings‚Äù. We didn‚Äôt build the fish, we can‚Äôt know. But we did build the LLMs. The maths is a little intimidating but you don‚Äôt need to be able to solve the equations to get the concepts.

Over hundreds of thousands of trials, they pattern-match successes vs failures to determine what makes an acceptable solution. Anything in this bucket is a yes, anything outside is a no. When they make something, they keep adding noise and then testing if that‚Äôs gotten then closer or further from the acceptable solution space.

It‚Äôs *so* dependent on the training data. we can‚Äôt see what features they‚Äôve decided are important when they‚Äôre making the determination (that‚Äôs what‚Äôs behind the issue called the alignment problem and why people say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt understand how they work‚Äù) but we still know that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing.

Reasoning would mean you could take that training and apply it to something you‚Äôve never seen: if I teach you to drive a car, you can figure out how to drive a train. It looks different, but you would start with principles of acceleration and braking and speed safety and signals/traffic lights and go from there. ANNs can‚Äôt.

The fact that chatgpt produces such impressive results is because their training set and the number of parameters they‚Äôre training on is mind bogglingly vast, but is not evidence of any kind of reasoning skill emerging.
