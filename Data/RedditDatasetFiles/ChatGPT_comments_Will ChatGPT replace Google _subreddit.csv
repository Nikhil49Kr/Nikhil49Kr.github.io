Pikachu and Jigglypuff had been the best of friends for as long as they could remember. They did everything together and were always there for each other. As they grew older, they began to realize that their feelings for each other went beyond friendship.

One day, Pikachu mustered up the courage to ask Jigglypuff to marry him. Jigglypuff, who had secretly been hoping for this moment, said yes without hesitation.

The two Pokemon were overjoyed and immediately began planning their dream wedding. They wanted it to be the grandest event Kanto had ever seen, and they left no stone unturned in their preparations.

On the big day, all of their friends and family gathered to witness the union of Pikachu and Jigglypuff. There was music, dancing, and of course, plenty of Diet Coke to go around. As the sun set on the horizon, the two Pokemon exchanged vows, pledging their love and devotion to each other for all eternity.

As they walked back down the aisle as husband and wife, Pikachu and Jigglypuff knew that they would face whatever challenges came their way, as long as they had each other and an ice-cold Diet Coke by their side. And they lived happily ever after.",t3_zztvin

Or perhaps we have teachers on strikes because schools are so badly founded than teachers spend good 20-30% of their own wages just to provide basic supplies for a classroom.

People have this crazy idea of a tech somehow overtaking jobs like a storm. Whe  the fact is that it will take many many years before anything like this happens. We don't have technical abilities to do anything on this scale nor will we suddenly see trillions invested in education to change things rapidly",t3_10uooj7
69,j7dv90y,t3_10uooj7,"No it won't ever. At least not for elementary school kids. There is no way an AI could replicate the physical presence and energy that a teacher brings to a classroom to create a learning environment.

70,j7dmibh,t3_10uooj7,"It absolutely will be replacing teachers and it will be a lot sooner than most think.   


People are biased in all aspects of AI job displacement due to self-preservation. They can't/refuse to come the realization that this will be the new reality. It happened when the internet first came out and it happened with cellphones. People will either get with the program or get left behind.   


Teachers will be replaced but not by robots in the short term. They will be replaced short term by chat bots like chatGPT and be used at home. It would cut government schooling costs by exponential amounts. But it's okay, almost everyone will be ""displaced"". They can just stay home and make sure their kids actually do their schoolwork. It would actually be objectively better because the AI could tailer to the students needs.",t3_10uooj7

72,j7dq9tf,t3_10uooj7,Definitely.  Students will be able to follow their interests and the AI will nudge them in the direction they need to go to achieve their goals.

I think there's a perfectly simple reason for that, an AI, could easily ensure that each individual student understands every step before going on to the next one, this does not happen in most classrooms. It would allow for different teaching styles tailored for each student, and try different teaching strategies to determine what suits that student.

To this day I love being in a bookstore. I honestly think it’s bc my mom and my early teachers read to me snd I associate books with love. Lots of stuff works like this. Half of ppls musical taste formed as teenagers is based on their emotional associations (or lack thereof) w the other ppl who like that music.

Learning is a social activity",t3_10uooj7

Its a highly subjective mark and can change the entire grading of a student to the better or worse regarding the personality of the teacher. At times its too random and make no sense in bigger class rooms - still Germany is one of the few countries that keeps this nonsense while majority of other countries just rate written exams. Germans believe this school system is universal and are often surprised when they learn that German speaking countries are the only ones using this system. I've witnessed cases where teachers gave marks based on personal preferences of students or their political view.  Its like a systematic conditioning. AI would be much fairer...",t3_10uooj7
84,j7ejcw7,t3_10uooj7,"It will absolutely not replace lower elementary teaching any time soon, which is more than half about instilling social norms in small children. You could probably make a touchscreen version that understands spoken language and could teach some reading, and the teacher would be more of just providing childcare. I think that would be a bad idea, though. 

It probably can replace much of secondary education as soon as it stops saying clearly false things with confidence.",t3_10uooj7
85,j7dqi1w,t3_10uooj7,"If an AI replaces teachers, we don’t need schools anymore. Society itself would completely collapse. What would be the point of learning anything if you can automate everything out? 

In more specific terms:

1. There’s more to education than the acquisition of hard knowledge. Schools play a fundamental role in socialization. In the US, it’s also a safety net for kids who can’t eat with school lunches. Plus, it prevents a breakdown in the social order - if kids are entirely on their own, who keeps discipline? Why won’t they just do whatever they want? Why not just have a ton of gangs? It’s exceedingly shortsighted to think teachers only teach or give information.

2. People who learn about AI see this as a magic wand. It’s very much a black-or-white way of thinking. Truth is that nothing works out as badly or as well as we tend to predict. Most of the discussions right now about “will AI replace X profession” is being driven entirely by emotion. We don’t have enough data yet to know how it will impact society. Period.",t3_10uooj7

MOOCs failed replacing college courses bc people have to learn how to learn throughout their entire education. I predict that it can do a good job reinforcing basics, strengthening reading, writing & math skills, in interesting ways that are tailored to individuals, which should leave teachers time to teach other skills & applications. Teaching will become much more tech-based, with emphasis on pedagogy.  The learning will be much more complex.

There will be several stages, now it's in just app form, but once they link the apps to screens, then later holograms, you'll be able to have for example, a Shakespeare avatar teach British lit, individually (or in a group if you want slower learners). Or have an Einstein ADaptive learning avatar (on screen or a floating hologram or VR) teach science.

Kids still bored? Switch to a high humor (but still solid content) Bugs Bunny to teach Geography. Or combine them.

ChatGPT can give you a sense of the potential.

Try this: ""Write a Shakespearean sonnet about the history of (X US state), using double entendre, in the voice of (favorite Looney Tunes character) and their catchphrases.""

Now take that result and put it in as real a visual form as technology allows, and welcome to the new AI teacher.

There will still be a need for humans, but instead of delivering the bulk of the content, kids will be progress at their own pace. The humans will be more like tutor/counselor, but they'll spend time helping kids one on one, clarify topics, projects and whatnot.

We had the beginnings for the tech 2 years ago, but Teacher's Unions were afraid of it then, more so now.

It's a shame, because we'd have trillions invested in adaptive learning by now if education money went to this model decades ago, and we'd probably all have a floating Gazoo hologram teacher by now.

* how to communicate effectively
* how to socialize
* how to handle conflict
* how to influence people/bots
* how to innovate
* how to be productive
* how to transform ideas into reality
* how to stay healthy mentally
* how to exercise properly
* how to think creatively (beyond what bots can do)
* how to interact with other neurodiverse people

My opinion is that this particular professor seems to have a simplistic vision of the two notions he proposes: teaching and AI.  

The fact is that a ""good"" teacher (by which I mean a trained, qualified and passionate person) can never be replaced by a robot. Because in my opinion, there is an artistic part in teaching and transmitting knowledge. 

We all preferred one or the other teacher because he or she was invested and inhabited by his teaching.  Robots are good at their automation. Certainly they will be able to help the teacher for, for example, simple information, documentation, factualization or other repetition exercises (""drill"").  

But an AI, for example, will never be able to make many analogies between a hydraulic system and an electrical system in order to teach series and parallel assemblies, demonstrate what the electrical intensity as well as the voltage in using an analogy with a ski slope, highways, etc.  She will not be able to find THE right animation or video to try out a very precise explanation, on the Joule effect and the agitation of atoms in order to show the heating of a resistance...  

I would add that a Robot will never handle chemicals so well to make complex reactions, use an elastic web to show Einstein's general relativity, etc, etc.

Also, look at the confidence it has in saying No player from Argentina has won it twice. The confident waffling is the reason Stackoverflow banned ChatGPT generated answers. Rightly so. I love the tool but its just not quite there yet. Embedding of factual knowledge in a language model, seems either a daunting task or a bad idea.",t3_zzc05s

182,j2cl2kj,t1_j2arj0c,No one cares about today.What they released is limited.They intended it to be so.There is so many research already released that next year will keep ChatGPT in dust.Gato model and various animal models by Deepmind.WebGPT by OpenAI.Text to video models.GPT models have input limit of 4096 tokens.There is research to remove it entirely.And of course there is Google with their expertise in Big Data.Add to that potential FactcheckGPT or whatever it will be called.,t3_zzc05s

184,j2cgocu,t1_j2cgivv,I don’t see it replacing Google. A text generator replacing a real time search engine? It’s very apples to oranges. Notice the word “replace” lol,t3_zzc05s
185,j2cl7gk,t1_j2cl2kj,Google has LamDA yes. With their resources and research capacity I wouldn’t be surprised if google owns this space sooner or later. Google has the upper hand long term  IMHO.,t3_zzc05s
186,j2e4vsi,t1_j2e4pou,"Wait , it knows Argentina won in 1978. But it doesn’t know it also won in 1986. It should. Given it’s trained in Wikipedia until 2021. ChatGPT has its weakness and I’m pointing it out. Stop being a fanboy.",t3_zzc05s

189,j2e51r3,t1_j2e4vsi,Because it doesn't mean it was trained on every page of wikipedia or every piece of data. It's totally possible it was trained on something that contained information about 1978 and not 1986. Any other pedantic questions about things you don't understand?,t3_zzc05s

191,j2chcoo,t1_j2cgxsm,"They appear to share some similarities. At a very niche level. For example: Google isn’t meant to generate recipes , ChatGPT is very good at that. But what Google excels at is giving you a list of options to choose from. There’s a caveat though, ChatGPT lacks true knowledge about a topic and it waffles it’s way. Look into AI hallucination on Wikipedia.",t3_zzc05s
192,j2e5htg,t1_j2e51r3,You’re wrong. If you ask it differently it knows Argentina won in 1986. Like try asking “what year did Maradona win the WC?”  So it isn’t able to connect the vast amounts of information. I was quite surprised as it’s got many questions often right.,t3_zzc05s
193,j2e5odz,t1_j2e5htg,"Yes, it's clearly not a trivia bot trained on irrelevant information. If you spent 5 minutes training it on soccer history, it would probably figure it out.",t3_zzc05s
194,j2e6gcj,t1_j2e5odz,"How bad are your comprehension skills ? I said it knows it won it 1978 and 1986 if you change the prompts. So it has the training from Wikipedia. Problem is, it waffles with confidence. For example , when asked “ Which Argentina players have won the World Cup twice “?, it says” There are no Argentina players who have won the World Cup twice. Only Diego Maradona, who won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986, has won the World Cup twice. He also won the World Youth Championship in 1979 with Argentina.”

Now here it omits Daniel Pasarella as the correct answer. Not only that, Maradona never won the World Cup twice. The audacity of its waffling skills is quite baffling. The problem is not that it isn’t trained in the data. Prompt engineering has shown it has that knowledge , problem is: it isn’t able to connect the dots. That’s why people must be very careful on accuracy. After all it’s a text generator and it’s supposed to predict next tokens.",t3_zzc05s
