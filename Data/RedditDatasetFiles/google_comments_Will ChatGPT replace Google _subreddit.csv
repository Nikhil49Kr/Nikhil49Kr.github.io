Right, but Google works that way too. It doesn't understand the articles it presents to you, it just runs an algorithm and orders web results in what it thinks is the most useful order.

One of the main challenges is the need to have a large and comprehensive index of web pages and other content, as well as the ability to effectively rank and present relevant results to users. Google has spent many years and resources building its index and ranking algorithms, and it is continuously working to improve and refine them.  
Another challenge is the need to have a user-friendly interface and a seamless user experience. Search engines need to be easy to use and navigate, and they need to be able to handle a wide range of queries and return relevant results quickly.  
Finally, search engines also need to be able to handle a variety of languages and countries, as well as handle different types of content such as images, video, and maps.  
Overall, it is a significant undertaking to develop a search engine that can compete with established platforms like Google Search, and it requires significant resources and expertise.",t3_zywq9z

Another good example someone mentioned was ""How did ww2 start?"". Google gives you a path to find the answer, but Chatgpt will outright give you an answer.

Even with those caveats, if reputable sources for training are provided, the ability to aggregate, summarize and display answers to questions is amazing and adds a level of capability far above simple weighted searching.  I'm sure Google has similar deep learning capabilities but is trying to figure out how to incorporate it into search where sources can also be displayed.

LLM's can do this specific task much, much better for *most* general information queries.

It would then be rented to law firms and used by lawyers, who would be able to spot mistakes in the output.

Or Putin mobilizes a troll army to feed fake news into the system to influence the inner politics of a foreign country. 

Or if Elon Musk or a similar personality buys the system and sabotages the model from the inside, for any type of personal gain. 

I think ChatGPT's way of reading and ""understanding"" the user request is really impressive. If you tell it that you want a text in the style of Donald Trump, it knows what to deliver.

Sure, what I'm getting at is that even for Google Search's main thing of looking up the answers to factual questions, it has a massive edge.

Google has an opportunity to build something better -- they clearly already have similar tech, so combine that with Search and their whole Knowledge Graph thing to try to fact-check the chatbot output... but that might be harder than it sounds. And Google isn't the only search engine, so there's no guarantee that they'll get there first.

ChatGPT *as it is today* isn't a risk to Google, as you really have to use them together if you want factual answers. But that could change very quickly.

And there's again the question of: What if most people are fine with [answers that reinforce their assumptions, rather than answers that are actually true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJD1Iwy5lUY&t=46s)?",t3_10pyvri
240,j6r99pe,t1_j6r4x76,"> Ignore current processing speed as that will improve.

That's not obvious, especially since the way it works now, it's not making you wait for extra processing time, it's slowing you down to make it look more conversational (and discourage you from trying to do too much too fast).

So what you're actually talking about is this model eventually getting *cheaper to run.* Maybe. But will it actually become cheaper than Google is now? Or cheap enough to not matter?

> How many times does Google search return exactly what you're looking for first time?

...most of the time? Especially if you count the second or third try, which is generally the same query with one more word added. And I usually don't have autocomplete enabled -- when I do, Google often returns exactly what I'm looking for *before I finish asking the question.*

Dialog is a feature that's great for *other* problems, like generating text and showing off at parties. But it often makes it *worse* at answering straightforward questions. Some example queries:

First, to even find some recent searches, what's my search history on Google? I typed ""search history"" on Google, landed at https://myactivity.google.com/ as the first result. So, let's be fair and start with the same query:

> > search history

> I'm sorry, I am an AI language model and do not have access to your search history. I can only provide answers to your questions based on the information I have been trained on.

I get much higher-quality results from ChatGPT when I actually type out my question properly, like I'm talking to a human:

> > How do I find my search history on Google?

> You can find your Google search history by going to your Google account's ""My Activity"" page. Here's how:
> 
> 1. Go to myactivity.google.com
> 2. Sign in to your Google account
> 3. On the ""My Activity"" page, you'll see a list of all your recent Google searches and other activity, grouped by date.
> 
> Note: If you've turned on Web & App Activity or Location History, your searches and other activity may be saved in those services and may not appear in My Activity.

It's... comprehensive, but inefficient. Most of this information is useless -- all it had to do was link me to that page. I can figure out how to sign in, and instead of telling me what I'll see, I could just... click through and see it? And I think that note is actually just flat-out wrong.

Oh, and the link isn't even clickable. If I ask, it'll give me a clickable link. But this now took three queries, two of which had to be written out longform in English, to get an answer that was an *instantaneous* two-word search on Google.

_Yes, that is correct. Google's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are highly intelligent and successful individuals who have played a major role in building the company into what it is today. However, as the technology industry evolves, companies like Google face new challenges and must make strategic decisions in order to remain competitive and continue to grow.

Google also invented the fundmental technology that ChatGPT uses.

There is a number of issues to provide something like ChatGPT and it is NOT the ads.

First, they have to be able to provide a source for something.   So that first has to be solved.

But the bigger issue is resources to provide at scale.  Google is literally handling 100s of thousands of search queries a second.

They did have the forsight to develop the TPUs.  That is critical.   But even that is not enough to be able to provide at scale because of the resources required.

If you made a graph that plotted data for each point in time the requirements for content creators increased you would see a decline in search quality.

Chatgpt ability to explain things is amazing though. I looked up how flatten works in some sql variant and really you can fire the tech writers at this point. The results were clear with examples and great suggestions.",t3_ztxifo
