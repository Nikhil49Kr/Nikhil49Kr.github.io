1,j1nvbju,t3_zv6pzu,Not with their current business model.,t3_zv6pzu
2,j1oxniq,t1_j1oju7k,Clickbait,t3_zv6pzu
3,j1pcapm,t1_j1oju7k,Well I‚Äôve seen people talk about it and wanted to share my view,t3_zv6pzu
4,j1nz29c,t1_j1nvbju,That was part of my conclusion also,t3_zv6pzu
5,j1qlov0,t1_j1nvbju,the amount of spam cluttering Google search results means they're forcing us away from them all on their own,t3_zv6pzu
6,j67w2jg,t3_10nbuo8,"No, I don't think ChatGPT will replace our jobs. It's a powerful tool for automation and natural language processing, but it's not capable of replacing the creativity and insight that humans bring to the table. ChatGPT may be able to automate certain tasks, but it won't be able to replace the human element of our jobs.",t3_10nbuo8
7,j68fgk7,t3_10nbuo8,"For some menial and low effort jobs, yes. For others, AI will provide efficient and dependable knowledge resourcing. Technology is really good at enabling, not so much at decision-making or determining right from wrong. AI should not be feared any more than human intelligence... both are equally able to destroy humanity without balance and proper controls in place for protection and quality of life.",t3_10nbuo8
8,j67ycck,t3_10nbuo8,Hopefully,t3_10nbuo8
9,j68prn1,t3_10nbuo8,I think it already has replaced some reddit posters job.,t3_10nbuo8
10,j69480s,t3_10nbuo8,"ChatGPT probably not. An Artificial General Intelligence, very likely",t3_10nbuo8
11,j6ab0w8,t3_10nbuo8,"ChatGPT is mostly a toy now. But within 5 years there will be AI tools that will make things 50x easier/quicker in most cognitive work professions.

It will create jobs.

It will be like Photoshop in the 90s. Graphic designers back then hated it. It made their job easier yet enabled noobs. Fast forward 10 years, there were 10x as many graphic designers, the profession paid well and the overall bar for quality went up. 

‚Äî

AGI may eliminate jobs but society will adjust. You may just get UBI to play in VR all day. The dream is real man üòá",t3_10nbuo8
12,j6apqzw,t3_10nbuo8,"I wrote an article about it. I don't think AI will replace my current job, but it would have replaced my job when I was getting started. My first jobs were menial, boring, low-paid and didn't require much thought. The absolute perfect thing for AI and ChatGPT is probably already plenty good enough for it.

13,j68294v,t1_j67w2jg,It will not replace our jobs completely but in some professions fewer people are going to be needed because one person with tools like ChatGPT can maybe be as efficient as 2 or more people and it is cheaper to have fewer employees.,t3_10nbuo8
14,j6a7pj8,t1_j67w2jg,"ChatGPT can create more jobs with the help of virtual customers. A robot customer can visit a store, is buying some gear oil and asks for the manager if he has a complain. To fulfill the needs of these AI enhanced paying customers lots of human labor is needed.",t3_10nbuo8
15,j68eowg,t1_j67ycck,More unemployment what‚Äôs not to like amright?,t3_10nbuo8
16,j68ejry,t1_j68294v,It will absolutely destroy jobs. It‚Äôs not a question.,t3_10nbuo8
17,j6iay2i,t3_10oy5he,You asked a clear question ‚Äúwill ChatGPT be better than Google search‚Äù yet the answers don‚Äôt say ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äúno‚Äù ‚Äúother middle options‚Äù. I might agree with all of your statements but still would want to say no,t3_10oy5he
18,j6hnxwh,t3_10oy5he,"MGoogle has far more data than ChatGPTs model, far more resources than OpenAI, and the infrastructure to support it. Of course Microsoft now opens OpenAPI and honestly, Bing has been better than Google for almost the last year in terms of returning useful links.

So essentially I think Google and Microsoft are going to have similar products with different focuses. I imagine that Microsoft is going to focus their model on developer related topics, where Google will focus theirs on more generalized questions. That's just my guess",t3_10oy5he
19,j6k65y2,t3_10oy5he,Terrible poll. Where is yes or no?,t3_10oy5he
20,j6mwc72,t1_j6k65y2,That's why we asked are there any suggestions. If so comment below.,t3_10oy5he
21,j70yri1,t3_10sefmx,"This is an interesting question! It's hard to say who will come out on top between ChatGPT and Google's Apprentice Bard. On one hand, ChatGPT is a natural language processing system developed by OpenAI that has been trained on millions of conversations. On the other hand, Google's Apprentice Bard is an AI-driven storytelling system that was designed to help create stories and immersive experiences. Both of these systems have their own strengths and weaknesses, so it will be interesting to see which one comes out on top!",t3_10sefmx
