1,j71ck90,t3_10sefa9,"Summary :  
Google is developing an alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot called Apprentice Bard, which can generate human-like text and code. It is built on LaMDA, Google's conversational-focused language model, and provides better responses over time. Apprentice Bard can reference recent events and produces high-quality conversational-style responses, but falls short in terms of understanding complex linguistic patterns compared to ChatGPT. Google is also testing a desktop search tool in a Q&A format and is considering integrating Apprentice Bard into its search engine. The outcome of Google's and OpenAI's efforts to create best-in-class AI chatbots remains to be seen, according to CNBC.",t3_10sefa9

6,j1drieu,t3_zt5ydb,You'll probably need to manually go to [https://chat.openai.com/](https://chat.openai.com/) so it can check your browser before the extension will work. Also consider the open-source competitor [chatgpt4google.com/](https://chatgpt4google.com/),t3_zt5ydb

10,j6r6rhr,t3_10pyz34,"Not the place for this but I’m convinced that google is barely functional anymore it’s so wrapped up in internal competition that it just doesn’t seem to be able to innovate anymore and when it does it’s unable to invest the time and money to allow it to grow into something 

I’d bet that google will spend the next decade declining kinda like Disney in the early 2000s — and by 2030 it’s gonna be on the brink of complete collapse as it’s major revenue streams continue to collapse and other companies  begin to be able to directly compete with them and their economies of scale 

And at that point google will either completely reinvent itself or collapse completely 

And by 2050people will either dub this time as googles flop era or people will write think pieces wondering how such a big company could disappear 

However, realistically our current Civ will collapse due to the imminent climate disaster as capitalism finds itself incapable of tackling the issue and by 2050 the majority of humanity will starve and society will completely collapse for at least a century",t3_10pyz34
