Chatgpt is based on an updated version of gpt3 (call it gpt3.5) and the chatbot was released as a kind of preview of gpt4.

will it replace google??

I really doubt it

***Am I the only one who doesn't like having only one answer?***

People are still going to want to investigate. Yes, chatGPT helps you research, but when I try to learn something new, I read a lot of articles that have different perspectives on the same topic.

Also, our content bubbles are already small enough. Can you imagine that everyone got the same answers from the same source? *shudder

Or even worse, a different answer from the same source. Have you tried deleting the conversation and coming back a day later to ask the same questions? I don't usually get the same answer.

GPT3 is likely a bot that we train to sound like a person who knows what they're talking about. Not really knowing many facts.

ChatGPT hints at a perhaps near future, but it has at least two major flaws, which are the inaccuracy of the data that is postulated as correct. Second, how do you release a language model into the world without it being influenced/modulated by nefarious actors? How do you trust the data you are being given? How do you know if you are making things up? These may be bigger challenges than we are led to believe from this ChatGPT demo.

I asked ChatGPT questions and he provided me with completely fabricated scientific studies, when I asked him to cite the author and DOI of the studies, it's all fictitious, it seems convincing until you look up the studies and find out they don't. I don't exist. It's certainly very fast, very convincing, but it's not really an AI assistant unless it's an assistant that does shit and is therefore far from reliable.

Yes, this appears to be world-changing technology, but it is actually currently the Emperor's New Clothes. We'll have to wait until GPT4 arrives to see what the progress looks like. There are some big challenges ahead for this technology to overcome.

***IN CONCLUSION***;

ChatGPT is predictive text generation. It's not an encyclopedia, it's not a web browser, it's not a web search, it doesn't even know anything recent. And he will directly lie to you.

Predictive text neural networks must be fed with selected data sets. They have to be cured because uncured data quickly overwhelms everything else and turns them into crazy Nazis, it's literally the story of all previous chatbots. That means it takes time for new information to reach them, which means you can't be up to date on anything recent.

It also magnifies any biases present in the data being fed. If you see that certain words appear together, you rate them as highly likely to go together. However, that means that if the only data you provide about the Middle East is about terrorism in the data sets, it will associate everyone in the Middle East with terrorism. If you only give him stories about white people, he will associate whiteness with ""good"" attributes.

ChatGPT also doesn't know what it doesn't know. It will gladly lie to you if it doesn't know an answer and spit out crashing programs. He is also trained in a wide range of subjects, but not all subjects. Good luck trying to come up with the best Elden Ring strategies, and gosh, don't trust anything that's truly life-threatening.

***Or maybe Google just buys them. It is standard business practice for large companies to buy promising startups and then close or integrate them***

the problem with buying them is that OpenAI is backed by Microsoft (and I think Nvidia) so they would probably be behind the queue if an acquisition was ever put on the table.

But Google has its own version with a more advanced training suite to be released next year. It's going to be an arms race, not a buy, I hope they release something to compete with instead of buying it like they always do.

They already have LaMDA in-house, they just haven't wanted to release it as ChatGPT for fear of misuse and bugs. ChatGPT already shows errors and problems.

However, all it does is show them the need to make a product using LaMDA sooner.

***A friend works at Google and he showed me some LaMDA talks and it's on par with what OpenAI is doing. It even leans more conversational and less robotic***

Super bullish on GOOG long term.

And Google is the only one that seems to be able to offer self-driving cars. Google has a lot of potential between its core business, calico and Waymo.

Shit got serious.

I can't wait for the google v2 experience where I don't have to rely on my search engineering skills.

Let's go google. speed up please

The problem is that google used to be searched, the first page results include the studies you wanted.

Now it's search, sponsored results, 13 pages of political opinions and news articles, loosely related study result I wanted.

ChatGPT has been a breath of fresh air - I may not be perfect and mess up from time to time, but I can quickly weed out the nonsense and find answers.

***Maybe if your search wasn't riddled with SEO spam and actually gave me what I wanted to see without having to add ""reddit"" to the end, I wouldn't be using ChatGPT***

The problem is when Google will steer you in completely different directions based on what it ""thinks"" you'll continue to see. It's not uncommon to get different search results based on things like region and create regional bias.

At the moment we don't know if Flamingo is better than ChatGPT because it's not open to the public.

But whoever the winner is, I believe future search engines will also be able to take commands such as ""Give me a list of the Pro's and cons of combining search engines with chat technology"".

 ChatGPT is not a search engine like Google and is not intended to replace it. ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI that is capable of generating human-like text based on a given prompt. It is not designed to function as a search engine or to perform any of the tasks that Google is capable of. Instead, ChatGPT is primarily intended to be used as a tool for natural language processing and generation tasks. It is not intended to compete with or replace Google or any other search engine.

By the way talk about ChatGPT. I'm using an extension of ChatGPT that it can integrate with search engines. It can't replace Google but it helps me a lot.

28,j1o76m3,t3_zv6q6p,"It is highly unlikely that chat GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or any other language model will replace Google as a search engine or as a company.

Google is a technology giant that has a wide range of products and services, including search, advertising, cloud computing, and hardware. The company has a strong focus on using technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. Google's search engine is used by billions of people around the world to find information on the internet, and the company's advertising business generates a significant portion of its revenue. In addition, Google has a strong brand and reputation, with a customer base that is loyal to the company and its products.

On the other hand, chat GPT is a language model that has been trained to generate human-like text based on a given prompt. It can be used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and text generation. While chat GPT and other language models have the potential to be very useful tools, they are not designed to replace Google or other companies that offer similar services. Language models are designed to assist with specific tasks, not to replace entire companies or industries.

In order for chat GPT or any other language model to replace Google, it would need to not only be able to perform all of the tasks that Google currently does, but also be able to do so at a level that is equal to or better than Google. This would be a monumental task, as Google has invested billions of dollars in research and development and has a team of highly skilled engineers and researchers working on its products and services. It is highly unlikely that a language model, no matter how advanced it may be, could replicate the capabilities of Google's products and services and the expertise of its employees.

Furthermore, even if a language model were able to perform all of the tasks currently performed by Google, it would still need to be able to do so at a scale that is comparable to Google. Google's products and services are used by billions of people around the world, and the company has the infrastructure in place to support this level of usage. A language model, no matter how advanced it may be, would not have the same level of infrastructure and would likely struggle to handle the same level of usage.

In addition to the technical challenges that would need to be overcome in order for a language model to replace Google, there are also legal and regulatory challenges to consider. Google operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. A language model would not have the same level of legal and regulatory compliance as Google, and it is unclear how it would be able to navigate these challenges.

In conclusion, it is highly unlikely that chat GPT or any other language model will replace Google. Google is a well-established company with a wide range of products and services, and it is not designed to be replaced by a specific tool like a language model. Chat GPT and other language models can be useful tools, but they are not designed to replace companies like Google.",t3_zv6q6p

AI is in the roots of Google.  It is not like something they have to figure out.

You can not do a large language model at scale for search unless you can dramatically drop the cost.

Google is far better positioned to do that than any other company.  OpenAI does NOT even have their own silcon.

Microsoft so f* up by going the FPGA route instead of making the investment into an ASIC like Google did.   It was because Microsoft just did not get it.

Google now has their fourth generation in production and woirking on the fifth.

Microsoft really does not do things themselves like Google but instead use others stuff or buys it.  So they use Google for their phone.  They use Google for their browser.

Here they are using OpenAI.

But what can Microsoft purchase or use to do inference at scale at a reasonable cost?

They could try to make a run at Nvidia but even nvidia can not do inference at scale nearly as cheaply as Google.

A phsycopath, incapable of feeling human emotion, can train themselves to cry or shout with joy or punch a wall in anger, but it would never quite feel right, like some emotional equivalent of the uncanny valley.

Someone who couldn't phsycally feel pain could train for years to flinch at the smallest bug bite, but it still wouldn't look right. 

Someone who had no musical improvisation skills, or who had no ability to blend into a character, could read every book on the subject, and might be able to pull off certain acts or certain songs, but could never have the flow or ability of someone with more improvisational or acting ability than them.

Similarly, an AI has no human mind, has no subconcious, an AI can never get absolutely blazed in college and decide trees are aliens, it will never spontaneously have an idea that changes the course of history, it will never think back on something it did and almost shut down because of how much it embaresses it, now, if we made robots who were in all respects human, this would change, but that is a can of worms so big it could feed a fisherman for decades.

An AI could watch a thousand rom-coms and study a thousand relationships, but it itself can never have a romantic relationship, and it itself can never relate to When Harry Met Sally or Ten Thing I Hate About You, it can understand why these things are relatable, and in that way Universal could totally make an AI script in the future that I might even watch on some random night, but it will never make a Rom-Com that can twist the story, or follow the story, in ways that envoke the genuine nature of watching a movie like that again. 

In my opinion, AI will absolutely replace the ""middle class"" of art, screenplay writers for the next spongebob episode, incidental music makers, shitty pop-stars, ETC, but the lower class and upper class of art will remain untouched by AI.

There will be even more counter examples in near future. I think, the opposite of what you are saying will happen. AI will master the art better than any human, simply because it can go through through all the content, that we recorded over thousands of years.

I am very confident, that if you take all the content of the internet, all the books, all the novels, all the blogs, all the YouTube videos, all the comments and you throw on top millions of conversations that chatGPT is having right now and 24/7 (basically thousands of years of conversations and always increasing)  couple that with perfect memory and it approximates the human condition, better than any single artist.

Better yet no matter what we do we can never understand someone in the 4th or 2nd dimension, unless we go there ourselves.

319,j6p13v3,t1_j6oz2ke,"Ye their new thing is supposed to be ""Sparrow"" from what I heard, will see if it's any good whenever it's out. The issue of the difficulty of censorship seems to be present in all LLM models.",t3_10q8bae
320,j6q7he1,t1_j6oz2ke,"The issue with Google is they look *too far* ahead. They are so slow to react in a field that is BOOMING right now. ChatGPT is gaining millions of users a month and cementing itself, while Google is shambling around like a drunk behemoth 

Sure, in 9 months they *might* finally release Sparrow or let us get a taste of it, by that time, ChatGPT will be cemented in people's vernacular nearly as much as ""Just google it"" is. 

Google needs to be doing something *right now*, not dicking around with gigantic grand plans for 45 years from now. They have multiple AI supposedly, they need to start showing *something* that keeps them on the radar or they will be Kodak 2.0 before they realize they are already dead",t3_10q8bae
321,j6wv9ml,t1_j6ugi89,"Not possible. There are hundreds of billions of connections in LLMs.

You'd need to employ thousands upon thousands of people for very cheap to prune the data, which openai did for a bit until giving up completely and resorting to banning topics.",t3_10q8bae
322,j6r25ud,t1_j6q3bzg,Why not? It's illegal to make meth. If someone makes meth that's on them,t3_10q8bae

324,j6qwc51,t1_j6q3bzg,That’s the type of short-sighted censorship only politicians can muster.   In no time these models are going to be running in reman Bitcoin rigs.,t3_10q8bae
325,j6q4j87,t1_j6p13v3,"Sparrow is technically from Deepmind, which is owned by Alphabet, but is distinct from ""Google"", who also produce models (like LaMDA). Sparrow is built over the Chinchilla model.",t3_10q8bae
326,j6p6zrw,t1_j6p13v3,they also have various image generation AIs that work totally different than the diffusion models (dalle/stable diffusion) which i doubt they'll release to public anytime soon.,t3_10q8bae
327,j6pjigf,t1_j6p13v3,"I've seen demos if sparrow, frankly it is awful. Maybe since then they have improved it - needs the censorship eased off quite a bit.",t3_10q8bae
328,j6qulvg,t1_j6q7he1,What happened to Kodak? Is it still around?,t3_10q8bae
329,j6shfxn,t1_j6r25ud,But what about instructions for home-made bombs. You really want chatbots to give detailled advice and tips on how to harm people?,t3_10q8bae

332,j6qutal,t1_j6qulvg,"It's still around, it's just mostly irrelevant compared to what it once was. 

We went from ""Kodak moment"" to zoomers not even knowing what a Kodak is. 

Google is in pretty big danger if they don't step up and do something",t3_10q8bae
333,j6spwwz,t1_j6shfxn,The chatbot is retrieving publicly available information. Bomb making is also illegal. If somebody makes a bomb it's on the person making the bomb.,t3_10q8bae
334,j6snx4d,t1_j6shfxn,I don't think that information is exactly hard to find through other means. I mean it already has to be in the AI's training data.,t3_10q8bae
335,j6r3csm,t1_j6qutal,"Google is still way easier to use for quick queries of trivia-like information.

Chatgpt requires their splash page to load, and then the multiple login pages, and then finally typing in your question. There’s too much friction on that platform right now for it to be anything other than something you open when you have time to spend.",t3_10q8bae
336,j6qv0sp,t1_j6qutal,"I read that Kodak sat on a bunch of inventions and patents and was upstaged by more agile and market oriented firms. 
Is this what you meant when you said google can turn into a Kodak 2.0?",t3_10q8bae
337,j6udizg,t1_j6spwwz,"That logic is flawed. The same argument is used by arms dealers who tell you ""if my client kills somebody it's entirely their fault""",t3_10q8bae

339,j6r3xaf,t1_j6r3csm,True. But most of these can be optimised to run very fast even 10x-100x faster with a drop in some accuracy. If they ever come up with a gpt version that is reliable even after such a drop in accuracy then it's always more convenient to ask chatGPT before resorting to search on Google. Hell you can even ask chatGPT to search on Google if they allow it to use the internet,t3_10q8bae
340,j6qvaqv,t1_j6qv0sp,"Yep, they sat on their laurels not doing anything, thinking they were too big to fail, then got crushed and left in the dust of time

Google is doing the same where they see the yappity dog and think they are too big for a tiny upstart to threaten, but the reality is they are in pretty real danger of losing significant market share fast",t3_10q8bae
341,j6ue7p5,t1_j6udizg,"If someone uses illegal weapons purchased from an arms dealer they have broken the law and done something wrong. Information about making bombs is not illegal. Building them is brain-dead easy. Building them is also illegal. If you build them you've done something illegal and done something wrong. If you provide the information on how to build them you have not done something illegal, because that information is not illegal to share. Nor should it be.",t3_10q8bae
