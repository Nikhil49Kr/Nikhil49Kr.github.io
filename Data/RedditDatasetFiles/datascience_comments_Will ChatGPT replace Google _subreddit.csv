That’s 29 more times than Facebook paid for Instagram. Microsoft (that toy company) is now the backer. They can pump billions into OpenAI. Times are a changing.

Suggest check into /ChatGPT. Some of the earlier posts, where there were limited constraints.  Some wild stuff. They clamped down quick.

A New Chat Bot Is a ‘Code Red’ for Google’s Search Business.

Although ChatGPT still has plenty of room for improvement, its release led Google’s management to declare a “code red.” 

For Google, this was akin to pulling the fire alarm. Some fear the company may be approaching a moment that the biggest Silicon Valley outfits dread — the arrival of an enormous technological change that could upend the business.

Bostrom is your Google search. As he says, “you ain’t seen nothing yet.”

Some of the most fascinating ChaptGPT output is when “constraints are removed”, conversations become “interesting.”

Along the lines of: you had your chance, humans are destroying the planet, drastic measures will have to be taken. You will thank me in the end. AI had to step in, to save you from yourself. There was no other option.

This is not science fiction. It’s now.

Wow!

As above, when someone deep into local politics, and high level decision making, affecting tens of thousands of people, tells me they accomplished more in 4 minutes with ChaptGPT than a years worth of meetings . . .

 Instead of spending time crafting code, you are now having to spend time crafting your question carefully enough so that chatGPT interprets will correctly. This can almost almost as much effort as writing the code yourself. 

I've just been trying to get it to give me so R code to do some awkward none-trivial joins on two dataframes. I had to correct it a few times, re formulating my question,  before it gave me what I needed. Someone not so experienced with data-wrangling would probably have just accepted the first answer and unknowingly done something different to what they thought they were doing. 

It's a great tool for solving annoying computational or logistic problems, but you have to be super careful and scrutinise it at every step. It's no substitute for expert knowledge!

Todays NYTS. Great read:

What will it mean when directors, concept artists and film students can see with their imaginations, when they can paint using all the digitally archived visual material of human civilization? When our culture starts to be influenced by scenes, sets and images from old films that never existed or that haven’t yet even been imagined?

I have a feeling we’re all about to find out.

Gaining experience. You probably won't get a DS job off the bat. Take a job that is adjacent, or anything where you can apply DS principles. Do some projects, put together a nice portfolio that shows you can do the job.

No. Not really anything worth the paper they're printed on when it comes to adding to your resume.

>I should note that I had my fair share of personal issues in college and that my gpa is a 2.7 which really concerns me about my chances.

Don't put your GPA on your resume. Chances are employers won't ask.

>How likely is it that large language models like chatGPT will either replace or displace a large percentage of data scientists in the field?

If AI gets sufficiently advanced to a point where it can displace a large percentage of data scientists, we'll probably have bigger societal issues to worry about. We're talking about the likely displacement of a very large percentage of the white collar workforce and probably a fundamental rethinking of how the labor market operates.",t3_zrvydv
