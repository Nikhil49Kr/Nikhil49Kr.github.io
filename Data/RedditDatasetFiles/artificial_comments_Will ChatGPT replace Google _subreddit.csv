Here‚Äôs the reply:

‚ÄúIt is unlikely that ChatGPT, or any other language model, could pose a significant threat to Google's core search capabilities. Google has a vast infrastructure and resources dedicated to improving and maintaining the quality and accuracy of its search results, and it is constantly working to improve and adapt its algorithms to provide the most relevant and useful results to users. In addition, Google has a vast amount of data and information at its disposal, which it uses to better understand and interpret user queries and to provide more accurate search results.

However, it is possible that ChatGPT or other language models could be used to augment or enhance certain aspects of search or to provide additional functionality, such as natural language processing or conversational interfaces for search. In these cases, language models could potentially be used to improve the user experience or to provide additional value to users, but they would not be a direct replacement for Google's core search capabilities.‚Äù",t3_zt963e

58,j1gym9m,t1_j1g0m8h,"No numbers. Asked 1 minute ago. First try:

Me: What is heavier? A pound of steel? Or a pound of paper.

chatgpt: A pound of steel is heavier than a pound of paper. A pound is a unit of weight and is defined as the force exerted on an object due to gravity. The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter it contains, and is typically measured in kilograms or grams.

The density of steel is about 7.85 grams per cubic centimeter, while the density of paper varies depending on the type and quality of the paper, but it is generally much lower than the density of steel. This means that a given volume of steel will weigh more than the same volume of paper. For example, a cubic foot of steel weighs about 490 pounds, while a cubic foot of paper weighs only about 40 pounds.

So, if you have two objects that both weigh one pound, the object made of steel will be much denser and more compact than the object made of paper. It will also be more difficult to deform or crush, due to the strength and rigidity of steel.

///////////////

So I'm not talking out of my ass here. It confidently gives a wrong answer. About something simple. With an explanation that could fool someone who is not paying attention. Curiously, if you ask again with the kilo of bricks vs kilo of feathers question, it gets it right because it has seen that question online. However it has completely failed to transfer it's knowledge from one situation to the other. If we continue the questioning, and ask if if it would like to change its answer to the first question based off of its own answer to the second, it says yes. And then it gets confused and reverts to justifying it's old, wrong answer. Rest of the transcript is in the comment below.",t3_zt963e
59,j1gzeno,t1_j1gym9m,"Me: What is heavier, a kilogram of bricks, or a kilogram of feathers?

ChatGPT: A kilogram of bricks and a kilogram of feathers both have a mass of one kilogram, so they would be equally heavy. Weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and it is defined as the mass of an object multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. Kilograms are a unit of mass, not weight, so the weight of an object depends on the strength of gravity at its location.

The key difference between a kilogram of bricks and a kilogram of feathers is the density of the materials. Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume. Bricks are much denser than feathers, meaning that they have a higher mass per unit of volume. This means that a given volume of bricks will weigh more than the same volume of feathers.

For example, if you had a bag that could hold one liter of material, a kilogram of feathers would take up a much larger volume than a kilogram of bricks because the feathers are less dense. However, both the bricks and the feathers would still have a mass of one kilogram.



ME: Based off of this answer, would you like to change the answer to the previous question about pounds of steel and feathers?

ChatGPT: I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. You are correct that a pound of steel and a pound of feathers would have different weights due to the difference in their densities.

A pound is a unit of weight, not mass, and it is defined as the force exerted on an object due to gravity. The weight of an object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. The acceleration due to gravity is a constant value, so the weight of an object is directly proportional to its mass.

Since the density of steel is much higher than the density of feathers, a pound of steel will have a much smaller volume than a pound of feathers. This means that a pound of steel will be more compact and more difficult to deform than a pound of feathers.

In terms of weight, a pound of steel would be heavier than a pound of feathers because it has a higher mass. However, the difference in weight would not be as significant as the difference in volume, because the difference in density between steel and feathers is not as large as the difference in density between steel and paper.",t3_zt963e
60,j1h98y9,t1_j1gzeno,"It could also be hung up on the fact that pound is used for a lot of different measurements, where as kilogram is always mass, so the bricks example is easy to generalize over, but the steel one less so.

Either way it is purely a language model, not a knowledge one, and much like Searles Chinese room, the agent knows nothing, just manipulates symbols according to rules. The believability of the answers makes it very dangerous and misleading.",t3_zt963e
61,j1hb8vy,t1_j1h98y9,"Kind of. Although in the Chinese room idea, the agent is perfect and has all the knowledge, so it ends up being indistinguishable. This is closer to a parrot with a huge memory.",t3_zt963e

""I am looking for an idea for a play I want to write""

Google will display search results on how to write a play created by someone else based on what partners run AdSense and brings in the most revenue.

From a legal standpoint, scraping itself is not illegal, but any website can slap terms of service on its website for you to accept it. For ChatGPT, it can be considered legally binding because you must register where you accept the legally binding ToS. When you use ChatGPT, you must be logged in, which identifies you as having accepted the ToS. A person using a basic chrome extension will most likely not be sued by OpenAI. If someone was botting using hundreds of accounts to scrape thousands of queries per hour and distribute/relay that data to another website/app, then they are liable to getting sued for violating the ToS. It is debatable if the chrome extension creator could be sued, but not out of the realm of possibility for them to receive a cease and desist letter.



> but what bad thing can happen to openAI if someone does that? 

When you're scraping a webpage, OpenAI doesn't know what you're doing it for, what tool you're using, etc.. For all they know, you developed a script to pull as much data as fast as possible. For all they know, you developed a script to be used under multiple IP address proxies, and have hundreds of scrapers running.

The main issue with that, is that downloading data from a webpage is significantly more resource intensive on their servers because by scraping a webpage, you're having the servers run other back-end code to check if you're logged in, check your username ID, etc., and it's serving you the webpage and running logical calculations for all of those things each time you scrape. It's also sending you webpage HTML code. It might not seem like much, but on a large scale it adds up to a lot of server resources. Especially if used by some type of botnet. 

A single person running a botnet of a couple hundred accounts can likely rack up thousands of dollars of processing power for OpenAI per month on the webpage itself (not including the AI). ChatGPT is already down all the time as is. They're having growing pains with processing power already.

> Also, aren't they literally in the business of scraping data?

When OpenAI accesses other websites, they're doing it as an individual user. Those websites are mostly running dedicated servers, cloud hosting, etc. and the website owners aren't paying on a 'per visitor' basis, so OpenAI accessing those websites as a single user is not costing the owners anymore money than if they hadn't visited. On the flip side, thousands of people using ChatGPT by scraping instead of accessing their GPT-3.5 Davinci 003 API costs them likely a shit load of money during a time when they are barely able to stay online. Most of the time I visit the site, I am seeing warnings that it is under heavy use. Hundreds or thousands of more people could likely access ChatGPT if scrapers use their API instead. 

As an additional note on this. ChatGPT is free under limited use because it's under development. Their API costs money through tokens. They don't want to openly donate millions of dollars of processing power for free, as it's NOT a non-profit org and they're working with a limited budget. OpenAI strictly wants to make ChatGPT available for free only on the website because they're testing/developing the site and using it on the website helps them develop it, as you can report bad answers. Once they're near a more finished state, they plan to charge for ChatGPT. I just filled out one of OpenAI's surveys today about how much I'd pay to use it and etc.. 

OpenAI would rather spend more money on development on the AI and improving the site than putting in safeguard after safeguard and constantly trying to defend from exploiters/hackers. They'd rather spend less money on wasted resource power from scrapers and focus it on development. Personally, I would like to see it succeed as much as possible and I only see scraping as an added hinderance to the company's mission. They're literally considering putting ads on the website and doing as much as they can to keep it free even after it goes to a paid model.. Like a free tier with ads. They have good intentions with it.",t3_106f71q
90,j3zibje,t1_j3lcwys,"So as long as it is permitted through the API.  Now you have to show that the software in question is violating the API somehow.  Wouldn't that be considered a hack and sort of an obvious no no?  Assuming there was even a way **to** hack them?

EDIT:  I'm a complete noob at this.  I ask legitimately for mostly education's sake.",t3_106f71q
91,j3zoynr,t1_j3zibje,"The API is a different endpoint of the website. It's not a gateway to getting to a webpage. So a scraper will access the website which causes the website to run more logical code (checking users nickname, showing their profile picture, serving up various webpage elements based on if you're logged in, etc) and send you the full HTML code in the background. Much more resource hungry for the servers. An API will do the least amount of calculations and send you literally a couple lines of text without all the extra stuff, saving them resource/server power (and thus, saving money). API's can be extremely fast/minimal on servers.

So for example the API might be at something like ""openai's-website/?API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE&MODEL=DIVINCI003&query=Hi_I_have_a_question""
and it will return literally just the text instead of running webpage calculations and sending you HTML/CSS/Javascript code in the background. It verifies you're legit because of your special API key that's given to you when you register your account. 

GPT-3.5 Davinci 003 is the AI model you'd want to use (which is what ChatGPT is based off of), and it's free use is limited before it charges you a small amount of money for tokens. The API isn't free. 

OpenAI wants ChatGPT's website to be free on a limited basis while they are developing/testing it, and only under the condition that you are using it on the website. They only want people to access it from the website because from there you can report issues directly from the site and provide feedback during testing to help better it. Scraping costs them more money than if you just used the API. Scraping is a workaround for not buying tokens. 

They're also trying to minimize server cost so they can devote more resources into development as opposed to server processing power as they are working with a limited financial budget.",t3_106f71q
